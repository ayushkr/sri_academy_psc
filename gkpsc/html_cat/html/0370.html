<h2>Relationship between Hardware and Software</h2>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Hardware and software are mutually dependent on each other. Both of them must work together to make a computer produce a useful output.
</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Software cannot be utilized without supporting hardware.
</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Hardware without a set of programs to operate upon cannot be utilized and is useless.
</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>To get a particular job done on the computer, relevant software should be loaded into the hardware.
</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Hardware is a one-time expense.
</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Software development is very expensive and is a continuing expense.
</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Different software applications can be loaded on a hardware to run different jobs.
</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A software acts as an interface between the user and the hardware.
</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>If the hardware is the &#39;heart&#39; of a computer system, then the software is its &#39;soul&#39;. Both are complementary to each other.
</p>
