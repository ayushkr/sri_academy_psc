<h1><em>Need</em></h1>

<p><em>Need</em> is a semi-modal verb because in some ways it is like a modal verb and in other ways like a main verb.
</p>

<p>We use <em>need</em> mostly in the negative form to indicate that there is no obligation or necessity to do something:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>You <strong>needn&rsquo;t</strong> take off your shoes.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>



<h2><em>Need</em>: form</h2>

<h3>Affirmative form</h3>

<p>Affirmatives with the semi-modal <em>need</em> are not common and they are used in formal contexts. There is almost always a negative word (e.g. <em>no one, nobody, nothing</em>) or phrase in the clause, even if the verb phrase is affirmative:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>No one <strong>need</strong> think that we are doing this every week.</em> (we are not doing this every week)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Nobody <strong>need</strong> know the name of the person who made the complaint.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Not a thing <strong>need</strong> change on this page.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Need</em> comes first in the verb phrase (after the subject and before another verb):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Let&rsquo;s forget about it. No one <strong>need</strong> know about it.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We can&rsquo;t use another modal verb with <em>need</em>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>No one <strong>need</strong> read this.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Not: <s>No one need must read this</s>. or <s>No one must need read this</s>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Negative form</h3>

<p>Warning:
</p>

<p>We form the negative by adding <em>not</em> after <em>need</em>. <em>Need not</em> can be contracted to <em>needn&rsquo;t</em>. We don&rsquo;t use <em>don&rsquo;t</em>/<em>doesn&rsquo;t/didn&rsquo;t</em> with the semi-modal verb <em>need</em>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>You <strong>need not</strong> spend a lot of money on presents.</em> (formal) (or <em>You needn&rsquo;t spend a lot of money on presents</em>.)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Not: <s>You don&rsquo;t need spend a lot of money on presents</s>.
</p>
</blockquote>



<h3>Question form</h3>

<p>The question form of the semi-modal <em>need</em> is not very common. It is rather formal. The subject and <em>need</em> change position to form questions. We don&rsquo;t use <em>do/does/did</em>.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Need</strong> we write this down?</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Not: <s>Do we need write this down?</s>
</p>
</blockquote>



<h2><em>Need</em>: use</h2>

<h3>No obligation (<em>needn&rsquo;t</em>)</h3>

<p>The semi-modal <em>need</em> is most common in the negative. We use it to show that there is no obligation:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>We <strong>needn&rsquo;t</strong> spend much time on this topic. It&rsquo;s not going to be in the exam.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Cans of soup <strong>needn&rsquo;t</strong> be kept in the fridge.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>No obligation in the past</h3>

<p>The semi-modal <em>need</em> has no past simple form. Instead, we use <em>didn&rsquo;t need to</em> or <em>didn&rsquo;t have to</em> when we express no obligation in the past:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I <strong>didn&rsquo;t need to</strong> buy any books. They were all in the library.</em> (main verb <em>need</em> + <em>to</em>)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(or <em>I</em> <strong><em>didn&rsquo;t have to</em></strong> <em>buy any books. They were all in the library</em>.)
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not: <s>I didn&rsquo;t need buy any books. They were all in the library</s>.
</p>
</blockquote>



<h3>Unnecessary events</h3>

<p>We use <em>needn&rsquo;t have + -ed</em> form to refer to events which happened but which the speaker considers were unnecessary:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>You <strong>needn&rsquo;t have waited</strong> for me.</em> (You waited for me but it wasn&rsquo;t necessary.)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>You <strong>needn&rsquo;t have bought</strong> so much food. There are only three of us staying for the weekend.</em> (You bought a lot of food but it wasn&rsquo;t necessary.)
</p>
</blockquote>



<h2>Semi-modal <em>need</em> and main verb <em>need</em></h2>

<p>We can use main verb <em>need</em> as an alternative to semi-modal <em>need</em>. Main verb <em>need</em> is followed by <em>to</em>and it changes with person, number and tense (<em>I, you, we, they need to; she, he, it needs to; I, you, she, he, it, we, they needed to</em>).

<p>Warning:
</p>

<p>We must use the main verb <em>need</em> when it is followed by a noun phrase or -<em>ing</em> clause:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>You <strong>don&rsquo;t need</strong> [noun phrase]an umbrella.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Not: <s>You needn&rsquo;t an umbrella</s>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>My hair <strong>doesn&rsquo;t need</strong> [-ing clause]cutting for at least another month.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Not: <s>My hair needn&rsquo;t cutting for at least another month</s>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><strong>Typical error</strong></h3>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>The main verb <em>need</em> is followed by <em>to</em> when used with another verb.
</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I <strong>need to</strong> have my hair cut.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Not: <s>I need have my hair cut</s>.
</p>
