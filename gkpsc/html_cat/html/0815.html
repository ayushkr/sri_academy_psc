<p>InSight: NASA to launch its first mission to study deep interior of Mars
</p>



<p>NASA will launch its first-ever mission <em>InSight (Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport)</em> to study the deep interior of Mars on May 5, 2018. It will be launched from Space Launch Complex-3 at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California aboard United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V rocket. The rocket will also launch two mini-spacecraft called Mars Cube One (MarCO) which is NASA&rsquo;s technology experiment.
</p>

<hr />
<p>InSight Mission
</p>

<p>InSight is stationary lander that will be first NASA mission since Apollo moon landings to place seismometer, a device that measures quakes on soil of another planet. It has been envisaged as part of NASA&rsquo;s Discovery Program mission that aims to place stationary lander equipped with seismometer and heat transfer probe on surface of Mars to study red planet&rsquo;s early geological evolution.
</p>

<p>InSight is terrestrial planet explorer that will address one of most fundamental issues of planetary and solar system science. It will help in understanding processes that shaped rocky planets of inner solar system (including Earth) more than four billion years ago. Its instruments include seismometer to detect marsquakes and probe that will monitor flow of heat in planet&rsquo;s subsurface.
</p>

<p>The robotic lander will perform a radio science experiment to study internal structure of Mars by deploying seismometer and a burrowing heat probe. It will measure Mar&rsquo;s vital signs such as pulse (seismology), temperature (heat flow probe) and reflexes (precision tracking). It will let scientists understand how different its crust, mantle and core are from Earth.
</p>

<p>MarCO
</p>

<hr />
<p>MarCO consists of two briefcase-sized CubeSats that will fly on their own path to Mars behind InSight. It will be first test of CubeSat technology in deep space or at another planet. They are designed to test new communications and navigation capabilities for future missions and may aid InSight communications but is independent of InSight mission. If successful, MarCOs will offer new kind of communication capability to deep space missions to Earth.

<p><strong>GOBAR-DHAN Scheme launched to promote wealth and energy from waste</strong>
</p>





<p>The Ministry of Drinking Water &amp; Sanitation has launched GOBAR (Galvanizing Organic Bio-Agro Resources) &ndash; DHAN scheme at National Dairy Research Institute (NDRI) Karnal. It was launched under Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin) by Union Minister for Drinking Water and Sanitation Uma Bharti.
</p>



<p>The GOBAR-DHAN Scheme aims to positively impact village cleanliness and generate wealth and energy from cattle and organic waste. It also aims at creating new rural livelihood opportunities and enhancing income for farmers and other rural people. Under it, villagers will be mobilized to create self-help groups (SHGs) and creative societies that will help in clean energy and green jobs initiative.
</p>

<p>The scheme focuses on managing and converting cattle dung and solid waste in farms to useful compost, biogas and bio-CNG, thus keeping villages clean, increasing income of rural households and generation of energy from cattle waste. It is an important element of ODF-plus strategy under Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin). The scheme envisages implementation of 700 bio-gas units in different states of the country in 2018-19.
</p>

<p>Background
</p>

<p>Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin) comprises two main components for creating clean villages. They are creating open defecation free (ODF) villages and managing solid and liquid waste in villages. The Ministry of Drinking Water &amp; Sanitation now is focusing on ODF-plus activities, including measures to enhance solid and liquid waste management after over 3.5 lakh villages, 374 districts and 16 States/UTs of the country were declared ODF.
</p>

<p>Significance of Scheme
</p>

<p>It will be hugely beneficial for country as India is home to highest cattle population in world which produces around 3 million tonnes of dung. It will encourage farmers to consider dung and other waste not just as waste but as source of income.
</p>

<p>It will provide many benefits to rural people by keeping villages clean and sanitized, improving livestock health and increasing farm yields. Under it, biogas generation will help to increase self-reliance in energy utilized for cooking and lighting.
</p>

<p>It will augment income of farmers and cattle herders. It will create new opportunities for jobs linked to waste collection, transportation, biogas sales etc.
</p>

<p>It will also provide stable fuel supply in market for oil companies and accessible credit in market through government schemes and banks for entrepreneurs.
