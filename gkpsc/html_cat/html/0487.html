<h1><em>Mean</em></h1>



<h3><strong>Understanding</strong></h3>

<p>We use <em>mean</em> to explain or ask what a word or phrase refers to. We form questions with <em>mean</em> with the auxiliary verb <em>do</em>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>What <strong>does</strong> &lsquo;strike&rsquo; <strong>mean?</strong></em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Not: <s>What means &lsquo;strike&rsquo;?</s>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Warning:
</p>

<p>We don&rsquo;t normally use <em>mean</em> in the continuous form when we are talking about expressing ideas:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>What does that sign <strong>mean</strong>?</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Not: <s>What is that sign meaning?</s>
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><strong>Talking about intentions</strong></h3>

<p>We use <em>mean</em> to clarify something that we have said or to explain what we intended to say:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A:
</p>

<p><em>You have to take the road by the church</em>.
</p>

<p>B:
</p>

<p><em>Which church?</em>
</p>

<p>A:
</p>

<p><em>Here&rsquo;s what</em> <em>I</em> <strong><em>mean</em></strong>, <em>Lynn: there are two roads ahead. Take the right-hand road</em>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We use <em>mean</em> followed by a <em>to</em>-infinitive to express intentions:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Sorry, I <strong>didn&rsquo;t mean</strong> to upset you.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I <strong>meant</strong> to call you before I left. I forgot.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We often use <em>keep meaning to</em> for longer-term intentions:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I&rsquo;ve got to go to the dentist. I <strong>keep meaning to</strong> make an appointment.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><strong>Talking about significance</strong></h3>

<p>We use <em>mean</em> to say that something is important or significant:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>The bracelet <strong>meant</strong> a lot to her. It had belonged to her grandmother.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Does this name <strong>mean</strong> anything to you?</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><strong><em>Mean</em></strong>: <strong>result in</strong></h3>

<p>We can use <em>mean</em> + noun to talk about one thing resulting in another:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Higher fuel prices will <strong>mean</strong> higher airfares.</em> (will result in or involve)
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><strong>Talking about necessity or obligation</strong></h3>

<p>We use <em>mean + -ing</em> form to talk about something necessary or the result of something:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I&rsquo;ll have to catch the 7 am train to Nottingham, which <strong>means</strong> getting up at 5 am.</em> (I need to get up at 5 am.)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We also use the passive <em>be meant to</em> to express obligation. It has a similar meaning to &lsquo;be supposed to&rsquo;:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Why are you watching TV? You&rsquo;<strong>re meant to</strong> be working.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>



<h3><strong><em>Mean by</em></strong></h3>

<p>We can use <em>mean by</em> to ask what somebody is specifically thinking of when they use a word or phrase:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A:
</p>

<p><em>We don&rsquo;t want to discourage her from studying</em>.
</p>

<p>B:
</p>

<p><em>It depends what you</em> <strong><em>mean by</em></strong> <em>&lsquo;discourage&rsquo;</em>.
</p>

<p>A:
</p>

<p><em>Well, I mean make her think we can&rsquo;t afford to pay for her</em>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><strong><em>Means</em></strong> <strong>(noun)</strong></h3>

<p>Even though it ends in an &lsquo;s&rsquo;, <em>means</em> is a singular noun. We use a singular verb with it. We use it to talk about a method of doing something:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>The most economical <strong>means</strong> of travelling to Aberdeen is by plane.</em> (the most economical method or way)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Not: &hellip; <s>most economical mean</s> &hellip; or &hellip; <s>most economical means are</s> &hellip;
</p>
</blockquote>



<h2><em>I mean</em></h2>

<p>Spoken English:
</p>

<p>We use <em>I mean</em> very commonly in speaking as a discourse marker. We use it when we want to add to what we have just said, to make a point clearer or to correct what we have just said:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>The law is not fair. <strong>I mean</strong>, it&rsquo;s just not right that he didn&rsquo;t go to prison.</em> (adding)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>It cost over &pound;200. <strong>I mean</strong>, that&rsquo;s more than most of us can afford.</em> (making something clearer)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>We need to ask Helen, <strong>I mean</strong> Harriet.</em> (correcting)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We often use <em>I mean</em> when hesitating, to make something negative less strong or to soften a disagreement:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A:
</p>

<p><em>What do you think of Ben?</em>
</p>

<p>B:
</p>

<p><em>Well</em>, <strong><em>I mean</em></strong>, <em>he&rsquo;s not very confident and not always sure what he&rsquo;s supposed to be doing</em>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I think Peter probably has a strong view about that. It&rsquo;s interesting &hellip; <strong>I mean</strong> I &hellip; what I said earlier and <strong>I mean</strong> Peter might disagree with me.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When we are not sure what to say, we sometimes use <em>I mean</em>. We often pause before or after it:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>She&rsquo;s not coming back, er <strong>I mean</strong>, erm &hellip; she and I have broken up.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Warning:
</p>

<p>We don&rsquo;t use <em>I mean</em> to introduce opinions. It is not the same as <em>I think</em>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I <strong>think</strong> we should stay at the Lakeside Inn.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Not: <s>I mean we should stay at the Lakeside Inn</s>.
</p>
</blockquote>



<h2><strong><em>You know what I mean</em></strong></h2>

<p>Spoken English:
</p>

<p>We often use the phrase <em>you know what I mean</em> (or <em>if you know what I mean</em> or <em>do you know what I mean?</em>) in speaking, to check that our listener understands what we are saying or to show that we assume the listener has the same opinion about something:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A:
</p>

<p><em>I just can&rsquo;t go to Norah&rsquo;s house</em>.
</p>

<p>B:
</p>

<p><em>Why&rsquo;s that?</em>
</p>

<p>A:
</p>

<p><em>I just don&rsquo;t like all the cats</em>. <strong><em>You know what I mean?</em></strong> <em>They&rsquo;re everywhere even in the beds</em>.
</p>

<p>B:
</p>

<p><em>Yeah, I have to say I&rsquo;m not a fan of cats either</em>. (A is checking that B understands that she doesn&rsquo;t like all the cats in Norah&rsquo;s house and she assumes that B is going to understand)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Ken isn&rsquo;t very helpful, <strong>if you know what I mean</strong>.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>We&rsquo;ve got white on the walls in the back room now, but I think he feels as though, pink is not the right colour for the front room, <strong>do you know what I mean?</strong></em>
</p>
</blockquote>



<h3><em>Mean</em>: typical errors</h3>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>We use auxiliary <em>do</em> in questions with <em>mean</em>:
</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p><em>What does &lsquo;rosehip&rsquo; <strong>mean</strong>?</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Not: <s>What means &lsquo;rosehip&rsquo;?</s>
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>We don&rsquo;t use <em>I mean</em> to introduce opinions:
</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>I think</strong> people shouldn&rsquo;t start university until they are 20.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Not: <s>I mean people shouldn&rsquo;t</s> &hellip;
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><em>Means</em> is a singular noun. We use a singular verb with it:
</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p><em>A very relaxing <strong>means</strong> of transport is the train.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Not: &hellip; <s>very relaxing mean of transport are the train</s>.
</p>
