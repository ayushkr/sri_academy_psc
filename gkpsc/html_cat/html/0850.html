<p><strong>SC questions government&rsquo;s justification for passing Aadhaar Act as Money Bill:</strong>
</p>



<ul>
	<li>The Supreme Court questioned the government&rsquo;s justification for passing the Aadhaar Act as a Money Bill.</li>
	<li>Countering the Central government&rsquo;s argument that the sole intent of the Aadhaar Act is to act as a weapon for delivering subsidies to targeted beneficiaries, the Constitution Bench led by Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra pointed to Section 57 of the Act.</li>
	<li>The Attorney General countered that the Act contemplated the plight of 300 million people in the country living below the poverty line. &ldquo;Money has to come necessarily from the Consolidated Fund of India to cover the expenditure of the delivery of targetted subsidies. Not a single provision in the Act is unnecessary or unrelated to the main purpose/pith and substance of the Act, which is giving subsidies,&rdquo; he argued.</li>

<strong>iii. </strong>VID of the user would give any authorised agency like a mobile company, limited details such as name, address and photograph, which are enough for any verification.<br />

<strong>v. </strong>UIDAI had stated that <strong>all authorised agency/service providers will have to compulsory accept VID for undertaking authentication from  June 1, 2018. </strong><br />
