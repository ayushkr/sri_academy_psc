<h2>Future: other expressions to talk about the future</h2>



<p>We use a number of expressions with main verb <em>be</em> when we refer to the future, especially the immediate future.
</p>



<h2><em>Be about to</em></h2>

<p>We use <em>be about to</em> + base form of the verb to refer to things that we expect to happen very soon. We often use it with <em>just</em>, for emphasis:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>The ferry is <strong>about to</strong> leave.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>The driver is <strong>about to</strong> collect them. Shall I phone to stop him?</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>We<strong>&rsquo;re</strong> just <strong>about to</strong> set off for a walk. Do you want to come?</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Warning:
</p>

<p>With time expressions, we don&rsquo;t use <em>be about to</em>, we use the present simple:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Hurry up, please! The coach <strong>is about to</strong> leave!</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Hurry up, please! The coach <strong>leaves</strong> in five minutes!</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Not: <s>The coach is about to leave in five minutes!</s>
</p>
</blockquote>



<h2><em>Be on the point of</em></h2>

<p>We can also use <em>be on the point of</em> + <em>-ing</em> form to refer to things that we expect to happen very soon. <em>Be on the point of</em> is similar to <em>be just about to</em>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I <strong>was on the point of</strong> leav<strong>ing</strong> my job but then I got promoted so I changed my mind.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>



<h2><em>Be due to</em></h2>

<p>We use <em>be due to</em> + base form of the verb to talk about things that are scheduled:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>The visitors <strong>are due to</strong> arrive at the factory at 10:30.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>



<h2><em>Be to</em></h2>

<p><em>Be to</em> + base form of the verb has a number of meanings. It is rather formal.
</p>

<h3>Obligations</h3>

<p><em>Be to</em> refers to what someone is obliged or required to do. We also use it to refer to formal decisions:
</p>

<p>[referring to an obligation]
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>If I <strong>am not to</strong> tell anyone, then that&rsquo;s simply not fair.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[making decisions at a business meeting]
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>So, George <strong>is to</strong> contact the Stockholm office, and Patricia <strong>is to</strong> speak to the Elsico representative. Agreed?</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Commands and instructions</h3>

<p>We can also use <em>be to</em> when we give someone commands or instructions:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>You <strong>are to</strong> report to the head office by 8.30 am.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>She<strong>&rsquo;s not to</strong> be late. OK?</em>
</p>
</blockquote>



<h3>Headlines</h3>

<p><em>Be to</em> is common in newspaper headlines to refer to events which have been fixed or decided. We don&rsquo;t always use the verb:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Prime Minister <strong>to</strong> announce emergency plan on climate change.</em> (a headline &ndash; used without a verb) (Full form: <em>The Prime Minister <strong>is to</strong> <em>announce an emergency plan on climate change</em></em>.)
</p>
