<h1><em>Want</em></h1>



<p>We use the verb <em>want</em> to talk about wishes and needs, and to give advice:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>What do you <strong>want</strong> for dinner tonight?</em> (wish or desire)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>The kitchen <strong>wants</strong> painting.</em> (needs)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>You <strong>want</strong> to get your tickets soon before they&rsquo;re all sold out.</em> (I advise you to)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most uses of <em>want</em> involve the simple forms of the verb (<em>want, wants, wanted</em>). When we are talking about wishes or desires we can also use the continuous form (<em>is wanting, was wanting, will be wanting</em>).
</p>



<h2><em>Want</em> meaning &lsquo;wish&rsquo; or &lsquo;desire&rsquo;</h2>

<p>We always follow <em>want</em> with a complement of some kind. The complement completes the meaning of the clause. The complement can be a noun or pronoun as an object, or a verb in the <em>to</em>-infinitive form, or an object plus a verb in the <em>to</em>-infinitive form:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A:
</p>

<p><em>D&rsquo;you</em> <strong><em>want</em></strong> <em>a drink</em><em>? I&rsquo;ve just made some coffee</em>. (noun object)
</p>

<p>B:
</p>

<p><em>Oh, yes, please</em>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Not: <s>D&rsquo;you want?</s>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>She said I could have her old bike, but I don&rsquo;t <strong>want</strong> it.</em> (pronoun object)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Not: &hellip; <s>but I don&rsquo;t want</s>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>This is a new kind of fruit juice I got. D&rsquo;you <strong>want</strong> to try it?</em> (<em>to</em>-infinitive)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Not: <s>Do you want try it?</s>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>The teacher <strong>wants</strong> her to do the exams again next year.</em> (object + <em>to</em>-infinitive)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Not: <s>The teacher wants that she does the exams</s> &hellip;
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In reduced clauses (e.g. short answers), we can use the <em>to</em> without its verb:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A:
</p>

<p><em>Is Elsa going to France with you?</em>
</p>

<p>B:
</p>

<p><em>No. She doesn&rsquo;t</em> <strong><em>want</em></strong> <em>to</em>. (She doesn&rsquo;t want to go [to France].)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Not: <s>She doesn&rsquo;t want</s>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>He wanted to leave school at sixteen, but his parents didn&rsquo;t <strong>want</strong> him to.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Warning:
</p>

<p>We don&rsquo;t use <em>want</em> with a <em>that</em>-clause:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I <strong>want</strong> you to tidy your room before the visitors come.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Not: <s>I want that you tidy your room</s> &hellip;
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><em>Want</em> with <em>wh</em>-words (<em>whatever you want</em>)</h3>

<p>We can use <em>wh</em>-words such as <em>what</em><em>, when</em><em>, whenever</em><em>, wherever</em><em>, whoever</em> before <em>want</em>. In such cases, it is often not necessary to use the infinitive <em>to</em> after <em>want</em>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>You don&rsquo;t have to stay for the whole lecture. You can leave <strong>whenever</strong> you <strong>want</strong>.</em> (or <em>&hellip; whenever you</em> <strong><em>want to</em></strong>.)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>A:
</p>

<p><em>Would you like some of these carrots from our garden?</em>
</p>

<p>B:
</p>

<p><em>Oh, yes, please</em>.
</p>

<p>A:
</p>

<p><em>Take</em> <strong><em>what</em></strong> <em>you</em> <strong><em>want</em></strong>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><em>Want</em> with <em>if</em></h3>

<p>In statements with <em>if</em>, it is often not necessary to use the infinitive <em>to</em> after <em>want</em>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>She can park her car at our house, <strong>if</strong> she <strong>wants</strong>.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, we use the infinitive <em>to</em> after <em>want</em> in negative clauses with <em>if</em>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>He doesn&rsquo;t have to stay the night <strong>if</strong> he <strong>doesn&rsquo;t</strong> <strong>want to</strong>.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><em>Want</em> in the continuous form</h3>

<p>We can use <em>want</em> in the continuous form to show indirectness or politeness:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Customer:
</p>

<p><em>We</em><strong><em>&rsquo;re</em></strong> <strong><em>wanting</em></strong> <em>to buy a new TV, but we&rsquo;re not sure what to get</em>.
</p>

<p>Assistant:
</p>

<p><em>Okay, sir. Let me show you some of them</em>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I <strong>was</strong> <strong>wanting</strong> to ask you something. Are you free right now?</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We can also use the continuous form to emphasise an ongoing or repeated process:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>We<strong>&rsquo;d</strong> <strong>been</strong> <strong>wanting</strong> to go to New Zealand for years, so his sixtieth birthday was a good excuse.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Now that she&rsquo;s a teenager she<strong>&rsquo;s</strong> <strong>wanting</strong> expensive things, you know, computers, clothes, sports stuff.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>



<h2><em>Want</em> meaning &lsquo;need&rsquo;</h2>

<p>We can use <em>want</em> with the -<em>ing</em> form of a verb to say that something is necessary or should be done. This usage is quite informal:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Your hair <strong>wants</strong> <strong>cutting</strong>.</em> (needs to be cut)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>That cupboard <strong>wants</strong> <strong>clearing</strong> out.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In informal situations, we can also use <em>want + -ing</em> in a similar way to the construction <em>have something done</em>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Have you got any shirts you <strong>want</strong> <strong>washing</strong>?</em> (which you want to have washed)
</p>
</blockquote>



<h2><em>Want</em> for advice and warnings</h2>

<p>In informal situations, we can use <em>want</em> plus the <em>to</em>-infinitive to advise, recommend or warn. It is almost always in the present simple, but we can also use it with <em>&rsquo;ll</em> (the short form of <em>will</em>):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>You <strong>want</strong> to be careful riding your bike in town. There&rsquo;ve been some bad accidents lately.</em> (you should be careful)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>What you&rsquo;ll <strong>want</strong> to do, you&rsquo;ll <strong>want</strong> to take that bit off and clean it with oil or something.</em>
</p>
