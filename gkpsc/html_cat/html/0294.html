<h2><em>Appear</em>: how something looks</h2>

<p>We use <em>appear</em> to say how something looks or seems to look. We usually follow it by an adjective or by a <em>to</em>-infinitive:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>They <strong>appear</strong> very disappointed.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>There <strong>appears</strong> to be a problem with the car.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>The people don&rsquo;t <strong>appear</strong> to know why they are here.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Less often, and in more formal situations, we can use appear with an adjective + noun:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>She <strong>appears</strong> quite a nervous driver.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We can use <em>appear</em> with <em>it</em> as a subject, followed by <em>as if, as though</em> or <em>that:</em>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>It <strong>appears</strong> as if you got the wrong directions to the school.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>It <strong>appears</strong> as though they were wrong.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>It <strong>appears</strong> that he was not the first choice.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>



<h2><em>Appear</em> meaning &lsquo;come into sight&rsquo;</h2>

<p><em>Appear</em> also means &lsquo;become noticeable&rsquo;:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Suddenly the figure of a man <strong>appeared</strong> in the distance.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>



<h2><em>Appear</em> or <em>seem</em>?</h2>

<p>We mostly use <em>appear</em> to talk about facts and events. We use <em>seem</em> to talk about facts, but also to talk about personal feelings and ideas. <em>Seem</em> is often used with a noun:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>His car <strong>appears/seems</strong> to have broken down.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>It <strong>seems</strong> crazy that we should have to pay twice!</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Not: <s>It appears crazy</s> &hellip;
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>It <strong>seemed</strong> a good choice at the time.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Not: <s>It appeared a good choice</s> &hellip;
</p>
