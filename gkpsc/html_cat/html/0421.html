<h1><em>Know</em></h1>



<p>We commonly use the verb <em>know</em> with a noun phrase, with a <em>that</em>-clause or with a <em>wh-</em>clause (e.g. <em>who</em>, <em>where</em>, <em>why</em>):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Do you <strong>know</strong> the music shop just by the market square?</em> (+ object)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>We <strong>know</strong> that this must be a difficult decision for you.</em> (+ <em>that</em> clause)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Do you <strong>know</strong> where to buy batteries for the watch?</em> (+ <em>wh-</em>clause)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We don&rsquo;t use continuous forms of <em>know</em>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>She&rsquo;s a really good teacher and <strong>knows</strong> the names of over two hundred of her students.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Not: &hellip; <s>and is knowing the names of</s> &hellip;.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>We&rsquo;ve <strong>known</strong> each other since we were children.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Not: <s>We&rsquo;ve been knowing each other</s> &hellip;
</p>
</blockquote>



<h2><em>Know how</em> + infinitive</h2>

<p>We do not commonly use <em>know</em> + <em>to-</em>infinitive. We use <em>know how</em> + <em>to-</em>infinitive:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Does he <strong>know how to play</strong> classical guitar music?</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Not: <s>Does he know to play</s> &hellip;
</p>
</blockquote>



<h2><em>Know</em> + object + infinitive</h2>

<p>In very formal English, we use <em>know</em> + object + <em>to-</em>infinitive:
</p>

<p>[extract from a reference for a job]
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I have worked with John Davidson for five years and <strong>know him to be</strong> reliable and hard-working.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Weather experts have never <strong>known it to snow</strong> as heavily as it has this spring.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>



<h2><em>Know</em> without an object</h2>

<p>To refer to general knowledge, we use <em>know</em> without an object:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A:
</p>

<p><em>They&rsquo;re opening a new terminal at Amsterdam airport</em>.
</p>

<p>B:
</p>

<p><em>Yes, I</em> <strong><em>know</em></strong>. (I know that they are opening a new terminal.)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We use <em>know</em> + object to refer to what we know from personal experience:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A:
</p>

<p><em>They&rsquo;re opening a new terminal at Amsterdam airport</em>.
</p>

<p>B:
</p>

<p><em>Yes, I</em> <strong><em>know</em></strong> <em>it</em>. (I know the one you mean. I have been there and seen the airport.)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We also sometimes use <em>know about</em> or <em>know of</em> when we say what we know from general experience (<em>know of</em> is more formal):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>What do you <strong>know about</strong> the origins of the American Civil War?</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Not: <s>What do you know the origins</s> &hellip;
</p>
</blockquote>



<h2><em>You know</em></h2>

<p>We use <em>you know</em> very often in speaking as a discourse marker. We use it to check that the people we are speaking to share the same knowledge as us and understand what we are saying:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>It&rsquo;s impossible to find time to go to the gym, <strong>you know</strong>, every day, isn&rsquo;t it?</em>
</p>
