<h1>Six Preposition Rules</h1>

<p>Prepositions form a small but very important word class. We use prepositions very frequently used. In fact, the prepositions <strong><em>to, of, in, for, on, with, at, by, from</em></strong> are all in the top 25 words in English. If you can understand and correctly use prepositions, it will greatly improve your fluency. And remember, there are not very many prepositions. There are only 150 prepositions and we only use about 70 of these commonly. The following rules will help you understand and use prepositions correctly.
</p>

<h2>1. A preposition must have an object</h2>

<p>All prepositions have objects. If a &quot;preposition&quot; does not have an object it is not a preposition&mdash;it&#39;s probably an adverb. A preposition <strong>always</strong> has an object. An adverb <strong>never</strong> has an object. Look at these example sentences:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>They are <strong>in</strong><strong> the kitchen</strong>.</em> (preposition <em>in</em> has object <em>the kitchen</em>)<br />
	<em>Please <strong>come in</strong>.</em> (adverb <em>in</em> has no object; it qualifies <em>come</em>)</li>
	<li><em>There was a doorway <strong>before</strong><strong> me</strong>.</em> (preposition <em>before</em> has object <em>me</em>)<br />
	<em>I had never <strong>seen</strong> it <strong>before</strong>.</em> (adverb <em>before</em> has no object; it qualifies <em>seen</em>)</li>
	<li><em>I will call <strong>after</strong><strong> work</strong>.</em> (preposition <em>after</em> has object <em>work</em>)<br />
	<em>He <strong>called</strong> soon <strong>after</strong>.</em> (adverb <em>after</em> has no object; it qualifies <em>called</em>)</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. <em>pre-position</em> means <em>place before</em></h2>

<p>The name &ldquo;<strong>pre</strong>position&rdquo; indicates that a <strong>preposition</strong> (usually) comes <strong>before</strong> something (its <strong>object</strong>):
</p>

<ul>
	<li>I put it <strong>in</strong><strong> the box</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>But even when a preposition <strong>does not come before</strong> its object, it is still closely <strong>related</strong> to its object:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Who</strong><strong> </strong>did you talk <strong>to</strong>? / I talked <strong>to</strong><strong> Jane</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. A pronoun following a preposition should be in object form</h2>

<p>The noun or pronoun that follows a preposition forms a &lsquo;prepositional <strong>object&rsquo;</strong>.  If it is a pronoun, it should therefore be in the <strong>objective form</strong> (<em>me, her, them</em>), not subjective form (<em>I, she, they</em>):
</p>

<ul>
	<li>This is <em>from</em> my wife and <strong>me</strong>.</li>
	<li>That&rsquo;s<em> between</em> <strong>him</strong> and <strong>her</strong>.</li>
	<li>Mary gave it <em>to</em> <strong>them</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Preposition forms</h2>

<p>Prepositions have no particular form. The majority of prepositions are one-word prepositions, but some are two- or three-word phrases known as complex-prepositions:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>one-word prepositions</strong> <em>(before, into, on)</em></li>
	<li><strong>complex prepositions</strong> <em>(according to, but for, in spite of, on account of)</em></li>
</ul>

<h2>5. <em>to</em> preposition and <em>to</em> infinitive are not the same</h2>

<p>Do not confuse the <strong>infinitive particle</strong> &ldquo;to&rdquo; (<em>to sing, to live</em>) with the <strong>preposition</strong> &ldquo;to&rdquo; (<em>to London, to me</em>).
</p>

<p><strong><em>to</em> as preposition</strong>
</p>

<ul>
	<li>I look forward <strong>to</strong><strong> lunch</strong><br />
	I look forward <strong>to</strong><strong> seeing you</strong><br />
	<s>I look forward to see you</s></li>
	<li>They are committed <strong>to</strong><strong> the project</strong>.<br />
	They are committed <strong>to</strong><strong> keeping the price down</strong>.<br />
	<s>They are committed to keep the price down.</s></li>
	<li>I am used <strong>to</strong><strong> cars</strong>.<br />
	I am used <strong>to</strong><strong> driving</strong>.<br />
	<s>I am used to drive.</s></li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>to</em> as infinitive particle</strong>
</p>

<ul>
	<li>They used <strong>to live</strong> in Moscow.</li>
	<li>They love <strong>to sing</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. The golden preposition rule</h2>

<p><strong>A preposition is followed by a &quot;noun&quot;. It is NEVER followed by a verb.</strong>
