<h1><em>Get</em></h1>



<p><em>Get</em> is an irregular verb. Its three parts are <em>get, got, got</em>. In American English, the -<em>ed</em> form <em>gotten</em> is common.
</p>

<p><em>Get</em> is a very common verb, especially in informal speaking and writing. <em>Get</em> has many different meanings and is used in many idioms. We use it less often in formal writing. <em>Get</em> has many different grammatical patterns depending on the meaning.
</p>



<h2><em>Get</em> meaning &lsquo;fetch&rsquo;, &lsquo;receive&rsquo;, &lsquo;obtain&rsquo;</h2>

<p>We commonly use <em>get</em> + object or <em>get</em> + indirect object + direct object when we mean, very generally, &lsquo;fetch&rsquo; or &lsquo;receive&rsquo; or &lsquo;obtain&rsquo;. In these examples the object is underlined:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>When are you going to <strong>get</strong> your new car?</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>They were all dismissed from the firm but two of them managed to <strong>get</strong> new jobs within a week.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These examples have an indirect object (io) and a direct object (do):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Can you <strong>get</strong> [IO]me [DO]an ice-cream? Thanks.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Can we stop here? I need to <strong>get</strong> [IO]Fiona and Steven [DO]some cash from the cash machine.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>



<h2><em>Get</em> meaning &lsquo;become&rsquo;</h2>

<p>We commonly use <em>get</em> + adjective to mean &lsquo;become&rsquo; or to describe a change of state or situation:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Put your coat and scarf on or you&rsquo;ll <strong>get</strong> cold.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Let&rsquo;s hope she <strong>gets</strong> better soon.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>It&rsquo;s <strong>getting</strong> dark.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>



<h2><em>Get</em> describing negative events</h2>

<p>We can use <em>get</em> + <em>-ed</em> form to describe things that happen to us, often things which are unfortunate and which we don&rsquo;t want to happen. We call this pattern the <em>get passive</em>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>The cottage <strong>got</strong> really badly damaged in the floods last year.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Sorry we&rsquo;re late. The train <strong>got</strong> delayed for over an hour outside Manchester.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>



<h2><em>Get</em> meaning &lsquo;cause something to happen&rsquo;</h2>

<p>When we use <em>get</em> + object (o) + <em>-ed</em> form, we say that we cause something to happen or to be done. It is a less formal way of saying <em>have something done</em>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I&rsquo;m <strong>getting</strong> the computer <strong>repaired</strong> on Monday.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I&rsquo;m going to the supermarket so I&rsquo;ll <strong>get</strong> your jacket <strong>cleaned</strong> if you like.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We also use <em>get</em> + noun phrase object (o) + object complement (oc) to mean that we cause something to happen:
</p>

<p>[at a hotel reception desk]
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Sorry to keep you waiting. We&rsquo;re just <strong>getting</strong> [O]the bill [OC]ready for you now.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Get</em> + object + infinitive with <em>to</em>, and <em>get</em> + object + -<em>ing</em> form have similar meanings of &lsquo;cause or persuade to happen&rsquo;:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>They <strong>got</strong> me <strong>to talk</strong> to the police, even though I knew it wouldn&rsquo;t help.</em> (They persuaded me to talk to the police &hellip;)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Can you help me <strong>get</strong> this printer work<strong>ing</strong>?</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Get</em> is a word with many different meanings. You will find other meanings of <em>get</em>, and phrasal verbs with <em>get</em>, in a good learner&rsquo;s dictionary.
