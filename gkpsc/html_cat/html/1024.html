<p><strong>Maiden test Next Generation SFDR Air to Air Missile successfully conducted</strong><br />
On 30<sup>th</sup> May 2018, India successfully performed the first test its new surface-to-air missile with nozzle less booster powered by <strong>Solid Fuel Ducted Ramjet (SFDR)</strong> technology, from launching complex-III of the Integrated Test Range (ITR) off Odisha coast.
</p>

<p><strong><u>New surface-to-air missile is powered by SFDR technology:</u></strong><br />
<strong>i. </strong>The missile has <strong>not been given a formal name yet</strong>. It has been indigenously designed and developed by <strong>Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).</strong><br />
<strong>ii. </strong>It is said to be the fastest missile in its class. It has the capacity to neutralise fast moving aerial targets.<br />
<strong>iii. </strong>The Solid Fuel Ducted Ramjet (SFDR) technology was developed by <strong>India in collaboration with Russia.</strong><br />
<strong>iv. </strong>The missile flew in its intended trajectory at a speed of <strong>Mach 3</strong> (three times the speed of sound). It performed as expected and perfectly validated the new indigenous technology.<br />
<strong>v. </strong>All radars, telemetry and electro-optical systems deployed along the coast tracked and monitored the health parameters of the missile system. The data generated during the test are analysed for future missions.<br />
<strong>vi. </strong>The indigenously developed SFDR will help India to master in the advanced technology which has been secured by only a few countries so far.<br />
<strong>vii. </strong>The new technology will help both surface-to-air and air-to-air missiles perform better. It will help to improve their strike range.<br />
<strong>viii. </strong>Through this India can have fastest long-range missiles in both surface-to-air and air-to-air categories.<br />
