<h1><em>Enjoy</em></h1>



<p>The regular verb <em>enjoy</em> means &lsquo;get pleasure from something&rsquo;. It usually has an object:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>We <strong>enjoyed</strong> the movie so much.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Enjoy</strong> your holiday in Ireland.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Not: <s>Enjoy in Ireland</s>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We also use <em>enjoy</em> to talk about getting pleasure from a situation we are in. In this case, we say <em>enjoy myself, yourself, herself, himself</em>, etc.:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Did you <strong>enjoy</strong> yourself last night?</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>We always <strong>enjoy</strong> ourselves when we go to Lynn&rsquo;s house.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Warning:
</p>

<p>We use the -<em>ing</em> form after <em>enjoy</em> but we don&rsquo;t use a <em>to-</em>infinitive:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I never <strong>enjoyed</strong> cycling.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Not: <s>I never enjoyed to cycle</s>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>They <strong>enjoyed</strong> meeting people on their trip around Italy.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Not: <s>They enjoyed to meet people on their trip</s> &hellip;
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Spoken English:
</p>

<p>In informal situations, <em>enjoy</em> is sometimes used on its own without an object. This is especially common in American English:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A:
</p>

<p><em>We&rsquo;re now going out for dinner</em>.
</p>

<p>B:
</p>

<p><strong><em>Enjoy!</em></strong>
</p>
