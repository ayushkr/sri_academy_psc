<h2>Brahmananda Sivayogi(1852 - 1929)</h2>

<p>Brahmananda Swami Sivayogi was a seer and a social reformer from the state of Kerala.
</p>

<p>He was instrumental in the establishment of Ananda Maha Sabha and Anandamatham. Right from the childhood, he was an atheist. Hence, he denounced idol worships and all forms of religions.
</p>

<p>According to him, the ultimate aim of the activities of all human beings should be to get the Ultimate Bliss or Paramanandam.
</p>

<p>The movement he spearheaded during the Kerala Renaissance period is considered as the golden period in Kerala history. His original name was Govindan Kutty. <br />
<br />
Brahmananda Swami Sivayogi was born as Govindan Kutty on August 26, 1852.
</p>

<p>He was born into an aristocratic Nair family. His parents were Nani Amma of Karat Nair family and Kunjikrishna Menon of Vellengi Ravanyaram.
</p>

<p>His birthplace was Nenmara in the Palaghat district of Kerala. As per the custom that was prevalent in the state, Govindan Kutty was staying with his mother Nani Amma and his father used to make occasional visits to him.
</p>

<p>In the formative years of his life, he was brought up in the orthodox way.
</p>

<p>In the early morning, he used to take the bath and visit the worship chamber in the house for prayers. As a child, Govindan Kutty was totally ignorant about the activities undertaken by him at his home. He was merely following the instructions given by the elders in the family.<br />
<br />
As a child, Govindan Kutty was watching the customs and rituals with disbelief.
</p>

<p>Inquisitive mind in him could not comprehend the irrational behavior of the society around him.
</p>

<p>He asked himself how people get segregated along the lines of caste and color when they are made of the same blood, bone and flesh.
</p>

<p>This fundamental question was troubling his mind. He started to think about the rationality of these customs.
</p>

<p>After thinking about this over a period of time, he realized that there was no rationality behind the observance of such customs and rituals.
</p>

<p>This realization was the starting point of the rationalist in him.<br />
<br />
Brahmananda Swami Sivayogi passed away on 10th September 1929.
