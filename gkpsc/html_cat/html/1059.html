<strong>The state of our air:</strong>
</p>

<ul>
	<li>India has scored <strong>5.75 out of 100 </strong>in <strong>air quality</strong>. Analysis of the winter (November and December 2017) and summer (April-May 27, 2018) air quality levels of 10 state capital cities infer that they are in the risk of a multi-pollutant crisis.</li>
	<li>They are also facing a severe health challenge. In summer Delhi had 65 per cent days when poor and very poor air quality was recorded. In winters it increased to 85 %.</li>
	<li>Only on 1 per cent of the monitored days in summer the air quality was satisfactory in Delhi.</li>
	<li>Lucknow was very worse in the winter. Very poor air quality was recorded on more than 70 per cent of the monitored days.</li>
	<li>Severe levels of air pollution was recorded on 24 per cent of the days. Thiruvananthapuram, Bengaluru and Chennai experienced comparatively better air quality.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The state of our water:</strong>
</p>

<ul>
	<li>In 18 Indian states and UTs, more than 82 per cent rural households are without a tapped connection. 70,736 rural habitats with a combined population of 47.4 million live on contaminated groundwater.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The state of our sanitation:</strong>
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Through Swachh Bharat scheme, 72.1 million individual household toilets have been constructed. But funds allocated for spreading awareness on this to rural people remains unused.</li>
	<li>In urban areas nearly one million households are waiting for more than six months for toilets to be constructed.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The state of our energy:</strong>
</p>

<ul>
	<li>The Central government&rsquo;s target of installing 175 gigawatt (GW) of renewable energy by 2022, is not seeing expected progress, with only 9 per cent of the roof-top solar target achieved so far.</li>
	<li>LPG distribution has taken place significantly in only 15 states. Even in those places majority of rural people rely on firewood for cooking.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The state of our forests:</strong>
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Major increase in forest cover, has taken place in the open forest category that includes commercial plantations which is not a good sign.</li>
	<li>There is a 146 per cent increase in forestland diversion for non-forest activities in the last one year with maximum diversions recorded in Madhya Pradesh, Telangana and Odisha. This totally accounts for 54 % of the total diverted area.</li>
	<li>Forest fires have increased by 125 per cent in just two years (2015-2017).</li>
</ul>

	<li>This accounted for 86 per cent of the total environment-related offences in India. The number of cases disposed per day is 9.3 on an average, as per 2016 data.</li>
	<li>If this slow speed continues, it will take six years for the court to finish the existing backlog.</li>
	<li>15 states witnessed an increase in environmental crimes between 2015 and 2016. Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Assam are some of the states that witnessed the highest number of registered environmental crimes.</li>
