<h1><em>Since</em></h1>

<p>We use <em>since</em> as a preposition, a conjunction and an adverb to refer to a time, and as a conjunction to introduce a reason.
</p>



<h2><em>Since</em>: time</h2>

<p>We use <em>since</em> to refer back to a previous point in time. We use <em>since</em> as a preposition with a date, a time or a noun phrase:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>It was the band&rsquo;s first live performance <strong>since</strong> May 1990.</em> (<em>since</em> + date)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I have been happily married for 26 years, <strong>since</strong> the age of 21.</em> (<em>since</em> + noun phrase)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We also use <em>since</em> as a conjunction to introduce a subordinate clause:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>It&rsquo;s so long <strong>since</strong> I saw them.</em> (<em>since</em> + clause)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Lenny had slept most of the way <strong>since</strong> leaving Texas.</em> (<em>since</em> + clause)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>He&rsquo;s been back to the office a few times <strong>since</strong> he retired.</em> (<em>since</em> + clause)
</p>
</blockquote>



<h2><em>Since</em> and tenses</h2>

<p>When <em>since</em> introduces an action or event at a point of time in the past, we can use the past simple or present perfect after <em>since</em> and the present perfect in the main clause:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>They haven&rsquo;t received any junk mail <strong>since</strong> they moved house.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>They haven&rsquo;t received any junk mail <strong>since</strong> they&rsquo;ve moved house.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We can use the past simple, present perfect or past perfect after <em>since</em> with the expression <em>it</em> + <em>be</em> + time + <em>since</em>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>It&rsquo;s been years</strong> <strong>since</strong> I rode a bike.</em> (<em>it&rsquo;s</em> = <em>it has</em>)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>It&rsquo;s been years</strong> <strong>since</strong> I&rsquo;ve ridden a bike.</em> (<em>it&rsquo;s</em> = <em>it has</em>)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>It&rsquo;s years since</strong> I rode a bike.</em> (<em>it&rsquo;s</em> = <em>it is</em>)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>It&rsquo;s years</strong> <strong>since</strong> I&rsquo;ve ridden a bike.</em> (<em>it&rsquo;s</em> = <em>it is</em>)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>It&rsquo;d been years</strong> <strong>since</strong> I&rsquo;d ridden a bike.</em> (<em>it&rsquo;d</em> = <em>it had</em>)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>It&rsquo;s been years since &hellip;</em> is more common in American English than <em>It&rsquo;s years since &hellip;</em>.
</p>

<p>When <em>since</em> introduces a state in the past that is still continuing in the present, we use a present perfect form of the verb after <em>since</em> and a present perfect form of the verb in the main clause:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Since</strong> I&rsquo;ve been back at work, I&rsquo;ve been feeling great.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>





<h2><em>Since</em> + <em>-ing</em></h2>

<p>We can use <em>since</em> + -<em>ing</em> form to refer to time when the subject of the verb is the same in the main clause and the subordinate clause:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Since</strong> leav<strong>ing</strong> school, he has had three or four temporary jobs.</em> (Since he left school, he has &hellip;)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Since</strong> mov<strong>ing</strong> from a Chicago suburb to southern California a few months ago, I&rsquo;ve learned how to play a new game called Lanesmanship.</em> (Since I moved &hellip;, I&rsquo;ve learned &hellip;)
</p>
</blockquote>



<h2><em>Since</em>, <em>since then</em></h2>

<p>We can use <em>since</em> or <em>since then</em> as an adverb of time when the time reference is understood from the context:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>His father doesn&rsquo;t talk to him. They had an argument a couple of years ago and they haven&rsquo;t spoken <strong>since</strong>.</em> (since they had the argument)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>They bought the house in 2006 and they&rsquo;ve done a lot of work on it <strong>since</strong> <strong>then</strong>.</em> (since 2006)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We use <em>ever since</em> as a stronger form of <em>since</em> or <em>since then</em>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>When I was young, I had a little collie dog, but one day he bit me really badly. I&rsquo;ve hated dogs <strong>ever since</strong>.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>



<h2><em>Since</em>: reason</h2>

<p>We use <em>since</em> as a subordinating conjunction to introduce a subordinate clause. We use it to give a reason for something:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Sean had no reason to take a taxi <strong>since</strong> his flat was near enough to walk to.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Since</strong> her husband hated holidays so much, she decided to go on her own.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>They couldn&rsquo;t deliver the parcel <strong>since</strong> no one was there to answer the door.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>





<h2><em>Since</em>: typical errors</h2>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>We don&rsquo;t use <em>since</em> with extended periods of time. We use <em>for</em>:
</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p><em>She was waiting <strong>for</strong> four hours.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Not: <s>She was waiting since four hours</s>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>We use <em>since</em>, not <em>from</em>, with a clause referring back to a point in time:
</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I&rsquo;ve been swimming <strong>since</strong> I was three years old.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I&rsquo;ve been swimming <strong>from</strong> the age of three.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Not: <s>I&rsquo;ve been swimming from I was three years old</s>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>We use <em>since</em>, not <em>once</em>, to introduce a reason:
</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I think I should have my money back <strong>since</strong> I didn&rsquo;t have what was promised in the brochure.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Not: <s>I think I should have my money back once I didn&rsquo;t have</s> &hellip;
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>We use <em>since</em>, not <em>ago</em>, after &lsquo;it&rsquo;s a long time&rsquo; when we refer back to a point in time:
</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p><em>It&rsquo;s a long time <strong>since</strong> your last letter.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Not: <s>It&rsquo;s a long time ago your last letter</s>.
</p>
