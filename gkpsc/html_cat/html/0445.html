<h1>Seem</h1>



<p><em>Seem</em> means &lsquo;appear in a particular way&rsquo;. We can use it as a linking verb (like <em>be</em>) or with a <em>to</em>-infinitive. We do not normally use <em>seem</em> in the continuous form:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>She <strong>seems</strong> very young to be a teacher.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Not: <s>She is seeming</s> &hellip;
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I <strong>seem</strong> to be the only person who hasn&rsquo;t heard the news.</em> (+ <em>to</em>-infinitive)
</p>
</blockquote>



<h2><em>Seem</em> as a linking verb</h2>

<p><em>Seem</em> as a linking verb is followed by an adjective or, less commonly, a noun:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>It <strong>seems</strong> strange that no one noticed that the window was broken.</em> (+ adjective)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Glenda <strong>seems</strong> happier these days.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Buying a new car <strong>seems</strong> a complete waste of money to me. A used one would be just as good.</em> (+ noun)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We can use the impersonal construction <em>it seems</em> or <em>it seemed</em> with a <em>that</em>-clause, or with <em>as if</em> or <em>as though</em> and a clause:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>It seems</strong> <strong>that</strong> the village shop will have to close down. They can&rsquo;t find a buyer for it.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>It seems</strong> <strong>as if</strong> he wants everyone to feel sorry for him, but I don&rsquo;t.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>It seemed</strong> <strong>as though</strong> time was standing still. She wanted that moment to last forever.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When <em>seem</em> is followed by a clause, we can refer to the person who experiences the situation using a prepositional phrase with <em>to</em>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>It <strong>seemed</strong> to everyone <strong>that</strong> the police were over-reacting, but no one dared to criticise them.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>It <strong>seems</strong> to me <strong>as though</strong> she needs help.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>It seems like</em> and a clause is less formal than <em>it seems that</em> &hellip;:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>It seems</strong> <strong>like</strong> he&rsquo;s going to sell his house and move to Canada.</em> (more formal: <strong><em>It seems that</em></strong> <em>he&rsquo;s going to &hellip;</em>)
</p>
</blockquote>



<h2><em>Seem</em> + <em>to</em>-infinitive</h2>

<p>We can use <em>seem</em> with a <em>to</em>-infinitive:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Tony always <strong>seems</strong> to offend people.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Everybody <strong>seemed</strong> to be ready, so we set off.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>The old man <strong>seems</strong> to have mistaken us for some people he knew years ago.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We can also use the impersonal construction <em>there seems to be</em> or <em>there seemed to be</em>, followed by a noun:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>There seems to be</strong> a mistake in these calculations. Can we check them?</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>There seemed to be</strong> no reason why she should not come with us, so we all travelled together.</em>
</p>
