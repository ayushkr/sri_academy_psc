<h1><em>Suggest</em></h1>

<p>We can use the verb <em>suggest</em> with a noun phrase, a <em>that</em>-clause, the -<em>ing</em> form of a verb or a <em>wh</em>-question word (<em>where</em>, <em>what</em>).
</p>



<h3><em>Suggest</em> + noun phrase</h3>

<p>We can use a noun phrase as the object of <em>suggest</em>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Can you <strong>suggest</strong> a good restaurant in this part of town?</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If we need to mention the person who receives the suggestion, we use a <em>to-</em>construction:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>My teacher <strong>suggested</strong> an exam I could take at the end of the year.</em> (or <em>My teacher</em> <strong><em>suggested</em></strong> <em>an exam</em> <strong><em>to me</em></strong> <em>which I could take at the end of the year</em>.)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Not: <s>My teacher suggested me an exam</s> &hellip;
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><em>Suggest</em> + <em>that</em>-clause</h3>

<p>When we suggest an action to someone, we can use a <em>that</em>-clause. In informal situations, <em>that</em> is often left out:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I <strong>suggest</strong> (<strong>that</strong>) you leave here around four o&rsquo;clock. The traffic gets very bad from about 4.30 onwards.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When <em>suggest</em> is in the past, we can use <em>should</em> in the <em>that</em>-clause:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Her doctor <strong>suggested</strong> <strong>that</strong> she <strong>should</strong> reduce her working hours and take more exercise.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><em>Suggest</em> + -<em>ing</em> form</h3>

<p>We can use <em>suggest</em> with the -<em>ing</em> form of a verb when we mention an action but do not mention the person who will do it, because it is understood in the context:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>She <strong>suggested</strong> travell<strong>ing</strong> together for safety, since the area was so dangerous.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><em>Suggest</em> + <em>wh-</em>question word</h3>

<p>We can use <em>suggest</em> with a question word such as <em>where, what, who, how</em>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Could you <strong>suggest where</strong> I might be able to buy a nice sweater for Mark?</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Can anyone <strong>suggest how</strong> we might attract more people to the next event?</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Typical errors</h3>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>We don&rsquo;t use <em>suggest</em> + indirect object + <em>to</em>-infinitive when we suggest an action to someone:
</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p><em>He <strong>suggested</strong> <strong>that</strong> I should apply for a job in a bank or insurance company.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Not: <s>He suggested me to apply</s> &hellip;
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>We don&rsquo;t use <em>suggest</em> + <em>to</em>-infinitive:
</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Henry wanted to tell everyone, but Dora <strong>suggested</strong> wait<strong>ing</strong> until the news had been announced officially.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Not: <s>Dora suggested to wait</s> &hellip;
</p>
