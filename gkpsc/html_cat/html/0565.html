<h1><em>Wish</em></h1>

<h2><em>Wish</em> + <em>to</em>-infinitive</h2>

<p>When we use <em>wish</em> followed by a verb in the <em>to</em>-infinitive form, <em>wish</em> means the same as <em>want</em>, but it is more formal. We do not normally use <em>wish</em> in the continuous form when we use it with a <em>to</em>-infinitive:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I <strong>wish</strong> <strong>to speak</strong> to Mr Hennessy, please.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Not: <s>I&rsquo;m wishing to speak to</s> &hellip;
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We don&rsquo;t use a <em>that</em>-clause after <em>wish</em> when it is a more formal version of <em>want</em>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>I wish to visit</strong> you in the summer, if possible.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Not: <s>I wish (that) I visit you in the summer</s> &hellip;
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We can use an object (underlined), before the <em>to</em>-infinitive:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I did not <strong>wish</strong> my family <strong>to know</strong> about Sara, so I told them nothing.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When we use an object after <em>wish</em>, we must also use a verb in the <em>to</em>-infinitive form. Alternatively, we can say <em>want</em> or (more politely) <em>would like</em>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>We <strong>wish to have</strong> a table near the window, please.</em> (or <em>We</em> <strong><em>would like</em></strong> <em>a table near the window, please</em>.)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Not: <s>We wish a table near the window</s> &hellip;
</p>
</blockquote>



<h2><em>Wish</em> + indirect object + direct object</h2>

<p>We use <em>wish</em> with two objects, an indirect object + a direct object (underlined), for expressions of good wishes and hopes that good things will happen to people:
</p>

<p>(io = indirect object; do = direct object)
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I <strong>wish</strong> [IO]you [DO]success in your new job.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I&rsquo;ve got my driving test tomorrow. <strong>Wish</strong> [IO]me [DO]luck!</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>We <strong>wish</strong> [IO]you [DO]a long and happy life together.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>



<h2><em>Wish</em> + <em>that</em>-clause</h2>

<p>We use <em>wish</em> with a <em>that</em>-clause when we regret or are sorry that things are not different. We imagine a different past or present:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I just <strong>wish</strong> that everything could be as it used to be.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In informal situations, we usually omit <em>that</em>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I <strong>wish</strong> I had his mobile phone number; we could tell him the good news.</em> (I don&rsquo;t have his mobile phone number; it would be good if I had it.)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I <strong>wish</strong> you hadn&rsquo;t told me how the film ends. You&rsquo;ve spoilt it for me.</em> (You told me how the film ends; it would have been better if you had not told me.)
</p>
</blockquote>



<h2><em>Wish</em> + verb forms in the <em>that</em>-clause</h2>

<p>The verb forms we use in <em>that</em>-clauses after <em>wish</em> are similar to the verb forms in conditional clauses after <em>if</em>. We use a past verb form for present and future meanings.

<p>When we wish something about the past, we use the past perfect after <em>wish</em>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I <strong>wish</strong> I <strong>had known</strong> Charlie was coming. I would have invited Jane.</em> (I didn&rsquo;t know it and did not invite Jane.)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I <strong>wish</strong> I <strong>hadn&rsquo;t said</strong> that. I can see I&rsquo;ve upset you. Sorry.</em> (I did say it; it would have been better if I had not said it.)
</p>
</blockquote>



<h2><em>Wish</em> + <em>would</em></h2>

<p>We can use <em>wish</em> + <em>would</em> if we are annoyed about something that is or is not happening, or about something that will or will not happen:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I <strong>wish</strong> you<strong>&rsquo;d</strong> stop making so much noise!</em> (You <em>are</em> making a noise; it would be better if you didn&rsquo;t.)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I <strong>wish</strong> you <strong>wouldn&rsquo;t</strong> come through the kitchen with your dirty boots on.</em> (You do come through the kitchen; it would be better if you didn&rsquo;t.)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In informal situations, we can use <em>wish</em> in the continuous form like this:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>He&rsquo;s embarrassing everyone. I<strong>&rsquo;m</strong> just <strong>wishing</strong> he would go away!</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Warning:
</p>

<p>We use <em>hope</em>, not <em>wish</em>, when we want something to happen in the future or when we want something to have happened in the past:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I <strong>hope</strong> the weather&rsquo;s fine tomorrow.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Not: <s>I wish the weather&rsquo;s fine tomorrow</s>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I <strong>hope</strong> they didn&rsquo;t miss their flight.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Not: <s>I wish they didn&rsquo;t miss their flight</s>.
</p>
