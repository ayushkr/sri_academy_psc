<h1><em>Go</em></h1>



<p>We use <em>go</em> to refer to movement, most commonly away from the speaker or listener to another place. We normally use <em>go</em> without an object:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Does this tram <strong>go</strong> to the city centre?</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Can you wait here while I <strong>go</strong> back to the house to fetch my jacket?</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Warning:
</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t confuse <em>go</em> and <em>walk</em>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Shall we take the bus or shall we <strong>walk</strong>?</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Not: <s>Shall we take the bus or shall we go?</s>
</p>
</blockquote>



<h2><em>Go</em> + -<em>ing</em></h2>

<p>We use <em>go + -ing</em> form when we speak about general activities that involve movement:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Jack and his dad have <strong>gone</strong> fish<strong>ing</strong> until later this evening.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>It was pouring with rain and all we could do was to <strong>go</strong> shopp<strong>ing</strong>.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the activities have a clear beginning and end, then <em>go</em> + <em>to-</em>infinitive is used:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>They&rsquo;ve <strong>gone to watch</strong> the tennis final.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Not: <s>They&rsquo;ve gone watching</s> &hellip;
</p>
</blockquote>



<h2><em>Go</em> + complement</h2>

<p>We use <em>go</em> + an adjective (complement) to describe changes to the state of things:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Don&rsquo;t let the coffee <strong>go cold</strong>.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Their car <strong>went wrong</strong> again just two days after it had been repaired.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Go</em> is a word with many different meanings. You will find other meanings of <em>go</em>, and phrasal verbs with <em>go</em>, in a good learner&rsquo;s dictionary.
</p>





<h2><em>Go and</em>, <em>come and</em> &hellip;</h2>

<p>In speaking, we often use <em>and</em> after <em>go</em> and <em>come</em> before the base form of verbs like <em>ask, buy, check, collect, do, find, get</em>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Why don&rsquo;t you <strong>go and ask</strong> her?</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I need to <strong>go and buy</strong> myself some running shoes.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Can you <strong>come and do</strong> the washing-up?</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>She should <strong>go and find</strong> another job.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Spoken English:
</p>

<p>In informal American English, speakers often leave out <em>and</em>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Would you like to <strong>come have</strong> lunch with us?</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I was expecting him to <strong>go get</strong> the keys.</em>
</p>
