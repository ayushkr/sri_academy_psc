<strong>On 5<sup>th</sup> May 2018, NASA launched InSight spacecraft aboard an Atlas V rocket to study &ldquo;Marsquakes&rdquo;, from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, United States.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong><u>InSight:</u></strong><br />
<strong>i. </strong>InSight has been designed to stay on the surface of Mars and listen to &ldquo;Marsquakes&rdquo;. The project costs $993 million.<br />
<strong>ii. </strong>The US spent $813.8 million on the spacecraft and rocket launch. France and Germany spent $180 million on the instruments.<br />
<strong>iii. </strong>A pair of mini-spacecraft named Mars Cube One, or MarCO are also launching on the rocket. It cost NASA $18.5 million.<br />
<strong>iv. </strong>The MarCO are briefcase-sized satellites. They will fly on their own path to Mars behind InSight. They will test tiny new deep space communications equipment.<br />
<strong>v. </strong>InSight aims to explore interior conditions on Mars, inform efforts to send human explorers to Mars, find out how rocky planets like Earth formed, etc.<br />
<strong>vi. </strong>InSight is expected to settle on Mars on 26<sup>th</sup> November 2018. <strong>InSight is the short form for Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport.</strong><br />
<strong>vii. InSight features a seismometer called the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure. It has been developed by the French Space Agency.</strong><br />
<strong>viii. </strong>After the lander settles down on the surface of Mars, a robotic arm will place the seismometer on the ground. The lander weighs 794 pound. It has been built by Lockheed Martin Corp.<br />
<strong>ix.  </strong>Another major instrument is a self-hammering probe. It will monitor the flow of heat on Mars&rsquo; subsurface.<br />
<strong>x. This is named the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package. It was developed by the German Space Agency along with Polish Space Agency.</strong><br />
<strong>xi. </strong>The probe will bore down 10 to 16 feet into the subsurface to measure heat from the interior. This will be 15 times deeper than any previous Mars mission.<br />
<strong>xii. </strong>The solar and battery-powered lander has been designed to operate for 26 Earth months that is one year on Mars. It is expected to observe nearly 100 quakes in that period.<br />

<p><strong>&lsquo;Tapanuli Orangutan&rsquo;, World&rsquo;s rarest ape on the edge of extinction</strong><br />
<strong>Scientists have said that, Tapanuli Orangutan, the rarest ape species on Earth, is on the verge of extinction.</strong><br />
<strong><u>Tapanuli Orangutan:</u></strong><br />
<strong>i. </strong>Less than 800 members of the Tapanuli Orangutan species are alive. They are in danger due to mega-projects, deforestation, road building, and poaching. This was mentioned in a study published in the journal Current Biology.<br />
<strong>ii. </strong>They would not survive unless immediate steps are taken to rescue them. This species was discovered in 2017 in Sumatra, Indonesia.<br />
<strong>iii. </strong>A major threat to them is a planned $1.6 billion mega-dam project to be constructed by a Chinese state-owned corporation.<br />
