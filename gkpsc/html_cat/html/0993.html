On May 24,2018, The <strong>World Health Organization (WHO</strong>) declared <strong>Nepal</strong> the <strong>first </strong>country <strong>to eliminate Trachoma.</strong>Trachoma was the <strong>second leading cause</strong> of preventable <strong>blindness </strong>in the Himalayan nation in the 1980s.<strong>&diams; </strong>The disease puts more than <strong>190 million people in 41 countries</strong> at the risk of blindness. It is responsible for the blindness or visual impairment of around <strong>1.9 million</strong> people worldwide.<br />

<strong>iii.</strong> The <strong>national trachoma programme</strong> in that country also collaborated with the <strong>Ministry of Education</strong> to include a module on <strong>trachoma </strong>in the school curriculum<br />
<strong>About Trachoma :</strong><br />
