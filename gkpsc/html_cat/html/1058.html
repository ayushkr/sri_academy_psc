<p><strong>ISRO&rsquo;s scientists discover an &lsquo;EPIC&rsquo; planet</strong><br />
A team of researchers from the <strong>Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad</strong>, have discovered a planet named EPIC.<br />
<strong>EPIC:</strong><br />
<strong>i. </strong>The planet is six times bigger than Earth. It revolves around a Sun-like star about 600 light years away. Both the planet and the star have been named as EPIC.<br />
<strong>ii. </strong>Now India has become one among the few countries that have discovered planets around stars.<br />
<strong>iii.</strong>Physical Research Laboratory&rsquo;s parent organization is Indian Space Research Organisation.<br />
<strong>iv.</strong>This discovery was made using a <strong>PRL-designed spectrograph, PARAS</strong>, to measure and confirm the mass of the new planet.<br />
<strong>v.EPIC 211945201b (or K2-236b)</strong> is the name assigned to <strong>the planet</strong> by the discovery team. The team was headed by Abhijit Chakraborty of PRL.<br />
<strong>vi.</strong>The <strong>host star</strong> is named as <strong>EPIC 211945201 or K2-236</strong>. The spectrograph is indigenously designed and the first of its kind in India that can measure the mass of a planet going around a star.<br />
<strong>vii.</strong>Very few spectrographs like this are available in the world that can do precise measurements like this.<br />
<strong>viii.</strong>The scientists observed the target over a time of 420 days or nearly 1.5 years. They measured the mass of the planet using the <strong>PRL Advance Radial-velocity Abu-sky Search or PARAS</strong> spectrograph integrated with the 1.2-metre telescope located at PRL&rsquo;s Gurushikhar Observatory in Mount Abu, Rajasthan.<br />
<strong>ix. </strong>PRL is considered the cradle of space sciences in India. It performs fundamental research in astronomy and space.<br />
<strong>x. </strong>EPIC was circling very close to the Sun-like star. It goes around it once in 19.5 days.<br />
<strong>xi. </strong>This <strong>might not be inhabited</strong>, as its surface temperature is very high around 600&deg;C. The planet is smaller in size than Saturn and bigger than Neptune.<br />
<strong>x. </strong>Its mass is 27 times that of Earth&rsquo;s and six times that of Earth in radius. Scientists have estimated more than 60% of its mass could be made up of heavy elements like ice, silicates and iron.<br />
<strong>xi. </strong>The research work will be published in the June issue of the Astronomical Journal of the American Astronomical Society.<br />
