<h1><em>Matter</em></h1>



<p>We can use <em>matter</em> as a verb or a noun. It is a very common word with a number of different uses and grammatical patterns.
</p>



<h2><em>Matter</em> as a verb</h2>

<h3><em><em>Matter</em></em> in the negative</h3>

<p>The most common use of the verb <em>matter</em> is in the expression <em>it doesn&rsquo;t matter</em> (and the less common forms <em>it didn&rsquo;t matter, it wouldn&rsquo;t matter</em> and <em>it won&rsquo;t matter</em>). <em>It doesn&rsquo;t matter</em> means &lsquo;it is not important&rsquo;, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t mind&rsquo; or &lsquo;it is not a problem&rsquo;:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A:
</p>

<p><em>I forgot to buy milk when I was in town</em>.
</p>

<p>B:
</p>

<p><strong><em>It doesn&rsquo;t matter</em></strong>. <em>We&rsquo;ve got enough till tomorrow</em>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>It doesn&rsquo;t matter</strong> if you can&rsquo;t be here by nine o&rsquo;clock. We can start without you and you can join us later.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>It wouldn&rsquo;t matter</strong> if we didn&rsquo;t invite Paul and Jan to the wedding. They wouldn&rsquo;t expect to be invited.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><em><em>Matter</em></em> in questions</h3>

<p>We can ask questions with <em>matter</em>, often followed by an <em>if</em>-clause. Questions with <em>matter</em> usually mean &lsquo;Is it a problem?&rsquo;:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Does it matter</strong> if I leave my computer on all night?</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Would it matter</strong> which flight we got?</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>A:
</p>

<p><em>I forgot to copy Chris in on the email to Margaret</em>.
</p>

<p>B:
</p>

<p><strong><em>Does it matter?</em></strong>
</p>

<p>A:
</p>

<p><em>I suppose not</em>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><em><em>Matter</em></em> in affirmative statements</h3>

<p>Less commonly, we can use <em>matter</em> in affirmative statements to say that something is important for a particular person, often with <em>to</em>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A:
</p>

<p><em>Sally says the school buildings are in a bad state</em>.
</p>

<p>B:
</p>

<p><em>Well, the local authority doesn&rsquo;t care. Nobody cares</em>.
</p>

<p>A:
</p>

<p><em>Well</em> <strong><em>it matters to Sally</em></strong>. <em>She has to work there</em>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>It matters to me</strong> that my children should be polite to adults.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>



<h2><em>Matter</em> as a noun</h2>

<h3><em><em>What&rsquo;s the matter (with &hellip;)?</em></em></h3>

<p>We can use <em>what&rsquo;s the matter (with &hellip;)?</em> to ask someone about a problem or to ask for an explanation of a situation that looks problematic:
</p>

<p>[adult to little child]
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>What&rsquo;s the matter</strong>, darling? Why are you crying?</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>What&rsquo;s the matter with</strong> Derek these days? He&rsquo;s acting so strangely.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Warning:
</p>

<p>We don&rsquo;t say <em>the matter is</em> &hellip;, we say <em>the problem is</em> &hellip;
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>He&rsquo;d like to live in the USA. <strong>The problem is</strong> he can&rsquo;t get a visa.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Not: <s>The matter is</s> &hellip;
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When we reply to the question <em>What&rsquo;s the matter?</em>, we don&rsquo;t use <em>matter</em>, we use <em>problem</em>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A:
</p>

<p><em>What&rsquo;s the matter with Greg?</em>
</p>

<p>B:
</p>

<p><strong><em>The problem</em></strong> <em>is he&rsquo;s just broken up with his girlfriend. They&rsquo;ve been together for a long time</em>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><em><em>Matter</em></em> as a countable noun</h3>

<p>We can use <em>matter</em> as a countable noun to mean &lsquo;question, problem or issue&rsquo;:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>This is a <strong>matter</strong> for the police. We cannot deal with it ourselves.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>It&rsquo;s only a <strong>matter</strong> of time before everyone will get bored with reality TV shows.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Are there any other <strong>matters</strong> to discuss today, or shall we finish?</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><em><em>Matter</em></em> as an uncountable noun</h3>

<p><em>Matter</em> as an uncountable noun means &lsquo;the physical substance that makes up the universe&rsquo;:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>How much <strong>matter</strong> is there in the entire universe? Scientists are not absolutely sure.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><em><em>As a matter of fact</em></em></h3>

<p>We can use the expression <em>as a matter of fact</em> to emphasise that something is different from what has been said before, or from what people think or expect:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A:
</p>

<p><em>I don&rsquo;t think you like Hilary, do you?</em>
</p>

<p>B:
</p>

<p><em>No, that&rsquo;s just not true</em>. <strong><em>As a matter of fact</em></strong>, <em>I&rsquo;m very fond of her. It&rsquo;s just that she irritates me sometimes</em>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><em><em>In a matter of</em></em> + time expression</h3>

<p>We can use the expression <em>in a matter of</em> with a time expression to refer to something that happens very quickly, or which can be done very quickly:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>It used to take an hour to get to the airport, but now with the new metro line you can get there <strong>in a matter of</strong> minutes.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>



<h2><em>No matter</em></h2>

<p>We can use <em>no matter</em> to link two clauses as a conjunction. It is a short form of <em>it does not matter</em>. We can use <em>no matter</em> with <em>what, when, where, which, who</em> and <em>how</em> to refer to a situation that cannot be changed, even though we try:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>No matter what</strong> I wear, I always feel dull and old-fashioned.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>No matter where</strong> she looked, she could not find the missing paper.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>He never answers emails, <strong>no matter how</strong> many you send him.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If there is just one clause, we use <em>it doesn&rsquo;t matter</em> before <em>what</em>, <em>when</em>, <em>where</em>, <em>which</em>, <em>who</em> and <em>how</em>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A:
</p>

<p><em>There are three phone numbers here for the tax office. Which one do I call?</em>
</p>

<p>B:
</p>

<p><strong><em>It doesn&rsquo;t matter</em></strong> <em>which one you use</em>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Not: <s>No matter which one you use</s>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We don&rsquo;t use <em>no matter</em> as a conjunction with <em>if</em>. We say <em>it doesn&rsquo;t matter if</em>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>It doesn&rsquo;t matter if</strong> you wear a smart suit, they still won&rsquo;t let you in without a tie.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
