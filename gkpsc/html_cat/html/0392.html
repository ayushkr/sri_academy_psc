<h1><em>Hope</em></h1>

<p><em>Hope</em> is a verb and a noun.
</p>

<h2><em>Hope</em> as a verb</h2>

<p>After <em>hope</em>, we often use present verb forms even when there is reference to the future:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>We <strong>hope</strong> she passes her driving test next week.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I just <strong>hope</strong> the bus is on time tomorrow.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Warning:
</p>

<p>We don&rsquo;t normally use <em>hope</em> in the negative:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I <strong>hope</strong> it doesn&rsquo;t rain.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Not: <s>I don&rsquo;t hope it rains</s>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The past continuous of <em>hope</em> is used to make polite statements and, especially, polite requests:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I <strong>was hoping</strong> to have a word with you, Professor O&rsquo;Malley.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>We <strong>were hoping</strong> you could lend us your car while you were in America.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>



<h2><em>Hope</em> as a noun</h2>

<p>We can use <em>hope</em> as a countable noun:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>In 1938, there was still a <strong>hope</strong> that war could be avoided.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>After the election, their <strong>hopes</strong> were high, but five years later nothing has changed.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When we mean <em>hope</em> in general, we do not use an article:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>You must never give up <strong>hope</strong>.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Not: <s>You must never give up the hope</s>.
</p>
</blockquote>
