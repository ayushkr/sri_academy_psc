<h1><em>Own</em></h1>



<p><em>Own</em> is a determiner and a pronoun.
</p>

<p><em>Own</em> emphasises that a thing belongs to a particular person, or was done by them. We always use a possessive form before <em>own</em>.
</p>



<h3><strong><em>Own</em></strong> <strong>as a determiner</strong></h3>

<p>We can use <em>own</em> as a determiner after a possessive determiner (e.g. <em>my, her, our</em>) or after a possessive noun phrase with <em>&rsquo;s</em>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I never sleep well in hotels. I always sleep best in <strong>my own</strong> bed at home.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>That garden wall is all <strong>Jason&rsquo;s own</strong> work. He spent several weekends building it.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><strong><em>Own</em></strong> <strong>as a pronoun</strong></h3>

<p>We can use <em>own</em> as a pronoun after a possessive determiner (e.g. <em>my, his, their</em>). We often use it in the pattern <em>noun + of +</em> possessive determiner <em>+ own</em>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>This is my wife&rsquo;s laptop. <strong>My own</strong> is being repaired.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Did you have a flat <strong>of your own</strong> when you were a student, or did you share?</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><strong><em>Own</em></strong><strong>:</strong> <strong><em>very own</em></strong></h3>

<p>We can emphasise <em>own</em> by using <em>very</em>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>When I was eight, we moved to a bigger house and I got <strong>my very own</strong> room and didn&rsquo;t have to share with my sister any more.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><strong><em>Own</em></strong><strong>:</strong> <strong><em>on</em></strong> <strong><em>my own</em></strong></h3>

<p><em>On my own, on your own, on our own</em>, etc. mean &lsquo;alone&rsquo; or &lsquo;without help from another person&rsquo;. They are less formal than <em>alone</em>. We can emphasise them by using <em>all</em>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>She lives <strong>on her own</strong> in a tiny flat.</em> (alone)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Nobody helped him build his boat. He did it <strong>all on his own</strong>.</em> (without help from anyone)
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><strong>Typical error</strong></h3>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>We don&rsquo;t use articles (<em>a/an</em>, <em>the</em>) before <em>own</em>:
</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p><em>As soon as teenagers reach the age of seventeen, they want their <strong>own</strong> car. They don&rsquo;t want to depend on mum and dad any more.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Not: &hellip; <s>they want the own car</s>. or &hellip; <s>they want an own car</s>.
</p>
