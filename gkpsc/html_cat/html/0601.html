<h1>Double negatives</h1>

<p>A double negative uses two negative words (in <strong>bold</strong> below) in the same clause to express a single negative idea:
</p>

<p>We did<strong>n&#39;t</strong> see <strong>nothing</strong>. [ = We saw nothing.]
</p>

<p>She <strong>never</strong> danced with <strong>nobody</strong>. [ = She didn&#39;t dance with anybody.]
</p>



<p>The rules dictate that the two negative elements cancel each other out to give a positivestatement instead, so that the sentence &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know nothing&rsquo; could literally be interpreted as &lsquo;I do know something&rsquo;.
</p>

<p>Double negatives are standard in many other languages and they were also a normal part of English usage until some time after the 16th century. They&rsquo;re still widely used in English dialects where they don&rsquo;t seem to cause any confusion as to the intended meaning. Nevertheless, they aren&rsquo;t considered acceptable in current standard English and you should avoid them in all but very informal situations. Just use a single negative instead:
</p>

<p>We did<strong>n&rsquo;t</strong> see anything.
</p>

<p>She <strong>never</strong> danced with anyone.
</p>



<p>There is one type of double negative that is considered grammatically correct and which people use to make a statement more subtle. Take a look at the following sentence:
</p>

<p>I am not unconvinced by his argument.
</p>



<p>The use of <em>not</em> together with <em>unconvinced</em> suggests that the speaker has a few mental reservations about the argument. The double negative creates a nuance of meaning that would not be present had the speaker just said:
</p>

<p>I am convinced by his argument.
