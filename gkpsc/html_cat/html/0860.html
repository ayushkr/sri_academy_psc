<p><strong>Researchers develop synthetic soft retina</strong><br />
Researchers from <strong>Oxford University</strong> have developed a synthetic, soft tissue retina which closely mimics the natural human retinal process. This breakthrough could lead to development of new, less invasive technologies that more closely resemble human body tissues and will help in treating degenerative eye conditions such as <strong>retinitis pigmentosa</strong>.<br />
<strong>About the new Synthetic Retina: </strong><br />
<strong>i.</strong> The new synthetic, double layeredretina replica consists of <strong>soft water droplets (hydrogels)</strong> and biological cell membrane proteins.<br />
<strong>ii.</strong> Unlike existing artificial retinal implants, the cell-cultures are created from natural, biodegradable materials and do not contain foreign bodies or living entities. Thus they are friendlier to the human eye.<br />
<strong>iii</strong>. It has been designed like a camera, wherein the cells act as pixels, detecting and reacting to light to create a grey scale image.<br />
<strong>iv.</strong> As of now, synthetic retina has only been tested in laboratory conditions. Before clinical trials in humans, it will be first tested with living tissues, followed by animal trials.
