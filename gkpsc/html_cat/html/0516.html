<h1><em>See</em></h1>



<p>We use the verb <em>see</em> to talk about using our eyes to be aware of what is around us:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>He turned on the light so that he could <strong>see</strong>.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Did you <strong>see</strong> that falling star?</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We can use <em>see</em> followed by an object and a verb in different constructions:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>We <strong>saw</strong> their car drive past the house yesterday.</em> (<em>see</em> + object + base form)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Not: <s>We saw their car to drive past</s> &hellip;
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Did you <strong>see</strong> the children playing?</em> (<em>see</em> + object + -<em>ing</em> form)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>On television, we <strong>saw</strong> Nelson Mandela presented with a special prize.</em> (<em>see</em> + object + <em>-ed</em> form)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Spoken English:
</p>

<p>When we see something as we are speaking, we usually say <em>can see</em> rather than the simple (<em>I see</em>) or continuous form (<em>I&rsquo;m seeing</em>):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I <strong>can see</strong> you in the photo. Look, there you are at the very back.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We use <em>see</em> to mean &lsquo;understand, know or be aware of something&rsquo;. We don&rsquo;t usually use this in continuous form:
</p>

<p>[one person is explaining how to use a computer software program]
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A:
</p>

<p><em>&hellip; All that appears on the screen is what you put in the value</em>.
</p>

<p>B:
</p>

<p><strong><em>I see</em></strong>. <em>Right</em>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Not: <s>I&rsquo;m seeing</s>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We can use <em>you see</em> when we are explaining something.
</p>

<p><em>They had no children. They married late</em>, <strong><em>you see</em></strong>.
</p>

<p>We also use <em>see</em> to mean &lsquo;meet or come into contact with someone&rsquo;, or &lsquo;visit a place&rsquo;:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>We went to <strong>see</strong> my mother at the weekend.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Have</strong> you <strong>seen</strong> Jerry lately?</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We can use the continuous form of <em>see</em> when it refers to an arrangement to meet someone:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I<strong>&rsquo;m</strong> <strong>seeing</strong> Harry at ten o&rsquo;clock tomorrow. What shall I tell him?</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We can also use the continuous form of <em>see</em> to mean &lsquo;meeting someone as part of a romantic relationship&rsquo;:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I asked her to go out on a date with me but she told me she <strong>was</strong> already <strong>seeing</strong> someone.</em>
</p>
