<h1><em>Marry</em> and <em>divorce</em></h1>



<p>We usually use <em>marry</em> and <em>divorce</em> with an object:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Lauren Bacall <strong>married</strong> her co-star, Humphrey Bogart, in 1945 and made three more movies with him.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>He always needed more money, and at 77 he <strong>married</strong> a wealthy widow, but she <strong>divorced</strong> him a year later.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, in formal styles we use them without an object:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>The couple <strong>married</strong> three years ago and have a daughter, Molly.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In informal language we use <em>get married</em> and <em>get divorced</em> when there is no object:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Paul and Katia <strong>are getting married</strong> in New Zealand.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>She finally <strong>got divorced</strong> last year.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We use <em>be married</em> and <em>be divorced</em> to describe the state of being married or divorced:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>They<strong>&rsquo;re divorced</strong> now.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>We&rsquo;ve <strong>been married</strong> for 50 years.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We don&rsquo;t use <em>to</em> or <em>with</em> after <em>marry</em>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>She <strong>married</strong> someone she met at college.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Not: <s>She married to someone</s> &hellip; or <s>She married with someone</s> &hellip;
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We use <em>to</em>, not <em>with</em>, after <em>get married</em> + direct object and <em>be married</em> + direct object:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>She <strong>got married to</strong> someone she met at college.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>She&rsquo;<strong>s married to</strong> someone she met at college.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Not: <s>She got married with someone</s> &hellip; or <s>She&rsquo;s married with someone</s> &hellip;
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We use <em>from</em> with <em>get divorced</em> and (less commonly) with <em>be divorced</em>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>She <strong>got divorced from</strong> her second husband.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>She <strong>is divorced from</strong> her second husband.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>She <strong>divorced</strong> her second husband.</em>
</p>
