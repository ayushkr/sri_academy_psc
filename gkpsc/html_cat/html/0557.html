<h1><em>Think</em></h1>

<h3><em>Think</em> meaning &lsquo;have an opinion&rsquo;</h3>

<p>We can use <em>think</em> to talk about having an opinion or idea. In this case, we don&rsquo;t usually use the continuous form:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I <strong>think</strong> (that) she&rsquo;s a very selfish person.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Not: <s>I&rsquo;m thinking (that) she&rsquo;s a very selfish person</s>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Ryan <strong>thinks</strong> we should leave by 8 am at the latest.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>A:
</p>

<p><em>What do you</em> <strong><em>think</em></strong> <em>about this frame?</em>
</p>

<p>B:
</p>

<p><em>To be honest, I don&rsquo;t</em> <strong><em>think</em></strong> <em>it suits the picture</em>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><em>Think</em> meaning &lsquo;make plans or decisions&rsquo;</h3>

<p>We use <em>think of</em> or <em>think about</em> to talk about making plans and decisions. We can use it in the continuous form (<em>thinking of/about</em>) plus the -<em>ing</em> form of the verb:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>We<strong>&rsquo;re thinking of</strong> moving out of London and buying a small cottage in the country.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Thinking about</strong> returning to college? Call Farrings College at Freephone 0800 009 122 445 for advice on courses and grants.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><em>Think</em> and <em>think of</em> meaning &lsquo;remember&rsquo;</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I went upstairs to get something, but when I got there, I couldn&rsquo;t <strong>think</strong> what it was that I wanted!</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Can anyone <strong>think of</strong> the name of the first dog that went into space?</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>It&rsquo;s so embarrassing when you meet someone and you can&rsquo;t <strong>think of</strong> their name.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><em>Think about</em> meaning &lsquo;consider something&rsquo;</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>A:
</p>

<p><em>Are you going to change jobs?</em>
</p>

<p>B:
</p>

<p><em>I&rsquo;m not sure. I&rsquo;m</em> <strong><em>thinking about</em></strong> <em>it</em>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Softening</h3>

<p>Spoken English:
</p>

<p>In speaking, we often use <em>I think</em> to soften what we say. It usually goes in end position:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>It&rsquo;s too expensive, <strong>I think</strong>.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Too many people are talking in the office, <strong>I think</strong>. It&rsquo;s difficult to work at times.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Uncertainty</h3>

<p>When we use <em>I think</em> to express uncertainty, it usually goes at the beginning:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>I think</strong> I gave the file to Holly on Monday.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>I think</strong> your keys are on the table.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><em>Don&rsquo;t think</em>: expressing uncertainty</h3>

<p>When we use <em>think</em> to express uncertainty, we usually put <em>not</em> with <em>think</em> rather than in the clause which comes afterwards:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I <strong>don&rsquo;t think</strong> we have enough people interested in going on the trip.</em> (preferred to <em>I think we don&rsquo;t have enough people interested in going on the trip</em>.)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>She <strong>didn&rsquo;t think</strong> it was necessary to give the taxi driver a tip.</em> (preferred to <em>She thought it wasn&rsquo;t necessary to give the taxi driver a tip.)</em>
</p>
