<h1><em>Look</em></h1>



<p>We use the verb <em>look</em> to mean &lsquo;turn our eyes in a particular direction to see something&rsquo;. It is followed by <em>at</em> to refer to the person or thing which we see:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>He&rsquo;s <strong>looking at</strong> me.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Not: <s>He&rsquo;s looking me</s>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Look</strong>, there&rsquo;s a massive spider!</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Don&rsquo;t <strong>look</strong> now.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[In a shop]
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A:
</p>

<p><em>Can I help you?</em>
</p>

<p>B:
</p>

<p><em>No thank you, I&rsquo;m just</em> <strong><em>looking</em></strong>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Warning:
</p>

<p>We don&rsquo;t use <em>look</em> with <em>if</em> or <em>whether</em>. We use <em>see</em> instead:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Can you <strong>see if</strong> there are any biscuits in the cupboard?</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Not: <s>Can you look if there are</s> &hellip;
</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Look</em> is used to form a number of phrasal and prepositional verbs (<em>look for, after, look up</em>, etc.). A good dictionary will give you information on these verbs.
</p>





<h2><em>Look</em> as a linking verb</h2>

<p>We often use <em>look</em> as a linking verb like <em>appear, be, become, seem</em>. As a linking verb, <em>look</em> does not take an object and it is followed by a phrase or clause which gives more information about the subject (a complement):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>That picture <strong>looks</strong> old.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>That jacket <strong>looks</strong> very expensive.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Look</em> as a linking verb is sometimes followed by <em>like</em>, <em>as if</em> or <em>as though</em>:
</p>

<h3><em><em>look like</em></em> + noun phrase</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><em>He <strong>looks like</strong> someone famous.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>It <strong>looks like</strong> a nice day outside.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><em><em>look as if</em></em>/<em>as though</em> + clause</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><em>She <strong>looks as if</strong> she is going to cry.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>They <strong>looked as though</strong> they had seen a ghost.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>





<h2><em>Look</em> as a discourse marker</h2>

<p>We sometimes use <em>look</em> as a discourse marker but it needs to be used carefully as it is very strong. We use it when we are explaining something or making a point, especially when we are annoyed or speaking very forcefully:
</p>

<p>[in a political debate]
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Look</strong>, too many people have died in this war.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[a boss talking to an employee]
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Look</strong>, Mark, you have been late for work every day this week. Is there a reason?</em>
</p>
