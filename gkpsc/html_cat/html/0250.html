<p>LAKE: NATURAL &amp; ARTIFICIAL (LIST OF LAKES IN INDIA)
</p>

<p>A lake is an area of variable size filled with water, localized in a basin, that is surrounded by land, apart from any river or other outlet that serves to feed or drain the lake.
</p>

<p>Lakes lie on land and are not part of the ocean (except for sea lochs in Scotland and Ireland), and therefore are distinct from lagoons which are shallow body of water separated from a larger body of water by barrier islands or reefs.
</p>

<p>Lakes are also larger and deeper than ponds, though there are no official or scientific definitions. Lakes can be contrasted with rivers or streams, which are usually flowing. However, most lakes are fed and drained by rivers and streams.
</p>

<p>Lakes can be broadly divided into two: &ndash;
</p>

<p>(i) Natural Lakes
</p>

<p>(ii) Artificial Lakes
</p>

<p>Lakes whether they are natural or artificial are of great value to human beings.
</p>

<p>(i) A lake helps to regulate the flow of a river.
</p>

<p>(ii) It prevents flooding and promotes agriculture.
</p>

<p>(iii) During the dry season, it helps to maintain an even flow of water and provides water for domestic proposes.
</p>

<p>(iv) Lakes are used for developing Hydro-electric power.
</p>

<p>(v) They influence the climate in the surrounding region.
</p>

<p>(vi) Lakes maintain the aquatic ecosystem.
</p>

<p>(vii) They enhance natural beauty and help develop tourism and provide recreation.
