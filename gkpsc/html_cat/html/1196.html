<hr />
<p>Blood is a type of connective tissue. It has a liquid matrix called plasma, in which the red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs) and platelets are suspended. The plasma contains proteins, salts and hormones. Blood flows and transports gases, digested food, hormones to tissues and waste materials from tissue to the liver and kidney.
