<h2><em>Little, few</em> with a noun</h2>

<p>We use <em>little</em> with uncountable nouns. We use <em>few</em> with plural countable nouns. They are used in formal contexts:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I&rsquo;m not very happy about it but I suppose I have <strong>little</strong> choice.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Few</strong> cities anywhere in Europe can match the cultural richness of Berlin.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[talking about a period of history]
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>At that time <strong>few</strong> people travelled who didn&rsquo;t have to.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>



<h2><em>(A) little, (a) few</em> without a noun</h2>

<p>We can use (<em>a</em>) <em>little</em> and (<em>a</em>) <em>few</em> as pronouns. We can use them to substitute for a noun when it is obvious from the context:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>After that, she began to tell them <strong>a little</strong> about her life in Scotland, particularly her life with the Rosenblooms.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Don&rsquo;t take all the strawberries. Just have <strong>a few</strong>.</em> (Just have a few strawberries.)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Little</em> and <em>few</em> are not very common without a noun. We use them in formal contexts:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Little</strong> is known about his upbringing and education.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Few</strong> would be in favour of police officers carrying weapons.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<h2><em>(A) little of</em>, <em>(a) few of</em></h2>

<p>We use <em>of</em> with <em>(a) little</em> and <em>(a) few</em> when they come before articles (<em>a/an, the</em>), demonstratives (<em>this, that</em>), possessives (<em>my, your</em>) or pronouns (<em>him, them</em>):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Put the flour into a bowl, blend with <strong>a little of</strong> the milk, beat in the egg yolks, then the sugar and the rest of the milk.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>A few of</strong> his films were seen abroad.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>



<h2><em>A little</em>: adverb</h2>

<p>We use <em>a little</em> as an adverb of degree. It is more formal than <em>a bit</em>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>He smiled just <strong>a little</strong>.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Her hands were shaking <strong>a little</strong>.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>



<h2><em>A little</em> with adjectives, determiners, adverbs</h2>

<p>We use <em>a little</em> before adjectives and adverbs to modify them. It is more formal than <em>a bit</em>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>She seemed to be getting <strong>a little</strong> better.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>What you need is <strong>a little</strong> more romance.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We often use <em>a little</em> with <em>bit</em>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I find that <strong>a little</strong> bit hard to believe.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>





<h2><em>Little</em>: adjective</h2>

<p>We use <em>little</em> as an adjective to mean &lsquo;small&rsquo;:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&lsquo;You&rsquo;re going to have a <strong>little</strong> baby brother, Martha,&rsquo; her mother told her one day.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I know a <strong>little</strong> restaurant not far from here.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><em><em>Little</em></em> or <em><em>small</em></em>?</h3>

<p><em>Little</em> and <em>small</em> have similar meanings. We use <em>small</em> to refer only to size. We use <em>little</em> to refer to size, but also to express a positive emotion (especially with words like <em>beautiful, lovely, wonderful</em>):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>He&rsquo;s a <strong>small</strong> baby.</em> (He&rsquo;s smaller than average.)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>He&rsquo;s a lovely <strong>little</strong> baby.</em> (He&rsquo;s lovely and small.)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>There&rsquo;s a wonderful <strong>little</strong> caf&eacute; a the end of the street.</em> (preferred to: <em>There&rsquo;s a wonderful small caf&eacute; at the end of the street</em>.)
</p>
