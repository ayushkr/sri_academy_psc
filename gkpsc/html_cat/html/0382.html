<h1><em>Happen</em></h1>



<p><em>Happen</em> means &lsquo;occur&rsquo; and most commonly &lsquo;occur by chance&rsquo;:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>What will <strong>happen</strong> if it rains?</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Will someone tell me what&rsquo;s <strong>happened</strong>?</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>A:
</p>

<p><em>You haven&rsquo;t been out in ages. When did you last go to the cinema?</em>
</p>

<p>B:
</p>

<p><em>It just</em> <strong><em>happened</em></strong> <em>that we went to see that new film last night</em>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Happen</em> + <em>to</em>-infinitive is common in polite requests or to describe something that occurs by chance:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>You don&rsquo;t <strong>happen</strong> to have any stamps, do you?</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>They just <strong>happened</strong> to be driving past so they stopped and had lunch and told us all about their holiday.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We use <em>happen</em> + <em>to</em> + object to say that something occurs unexpectedly or something occurs that we do not want:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Something&rsquo;s <strong>happened to</strong> my bike. The brakes keep squeaking.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>What&rsquo;s <strong>happened</strong> to your jacket? It&rsquo;s all covered in mud.</em>
</p>
