<p>There are two basic structures for the Present Simple:
</p>

<p>1. Positive sentences
</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>subject</td>
			<td>+</td>
			<td>main verb</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td> </td>
			<td> </td>
			<td><strong>Present Simple</strong></td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>2. Negative and question sentences
</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>subject</td>
			<td>+</td>
			<td>auxiliary <em>do</em></td>

<p>From the above table, notice the following points...
</p>

<p>For positive sentences:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>There is <strong>no auxiliary verb</strong>.</li>
	<li>We conjugate the main verb by adding <strong>s</strong> to the third person singular.</li>
</ul>

<p>For negative and question sentences:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>The auxiliary verb (do) is conjugated in the Present Simple: <em>do, does</em></li>
	<li>The main verb is invariable in base form: <em>base</em></li>
	<li>For negative sentences, we insert <strong>not</strong> between the auxiliary verb and the main verb.</li>
	<li>For question sentences, we <strong>exchange</strong> the subject and th
	<h2>How do we use the Present Simple tense?</h2>

	<p>We use the Present Simple to talk about:
</p>
	</li>
	<li>general time (action verbs)</li>
	<li>situations now (stative verbs)</li>
	<li>general time and situations now (verb <em>be</em>)</li>
	<li>
	<h3>Present Simple for general time</h3>

	<p>We use the Present Simple tense when:
</p>
	</li>
	<li>the action is general</li>
	<li>the action happens all the time, or habitually, in the past, present and future</li>
	<li>the action is not only happening now</li>
	<li>the statement is always true</li>
	<li>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td colspan="3">John <strong>drives</strong> a taxi.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><strong>past</strong></td>
				<td><strong>present</strong></td>
				<td><strong>future</strong></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td colspan="3"> </td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td colspan="3">It is John&#39;s job to drive a taxi. He does it every day. Past, present and future.</td>
			</tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>

	<p>Look at these examples:
</p>
	</li>
	<li>I live in New York.</li>
	<li>The Moon goes round the Earth.</li>
	<li>John drives a taxi.</li>
	<li>He does not drive a bus.</li>
	<li>We meet every Thursday.</li>
	<li>We do not work at night.</li>
	<li>Do you play football?</li>
	<li>
	<h3>Present Simple for now</h3>

	<p>For stative#1 verbs, we can use the Present Simple to talk about <strong>now</strong>. Stative verbs do not describe action. They describe state, and are verbs such as: <em>like, sound, belong to, need, seem</em>. We can use these verbs with the Present Simple tense to talk about about a situation at the present time, not general.

				That <strong>sounds</strong> interesting.<br />
				<strong>Do</strong> you <strong>need</strong> some help?</td>

				<td>The situation is now.</td>
				<td> </td>
			</tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>

	<h3>Present Simple for general time and now</h3>

	<p>The verb <strong>be</strong> is always special. It is a stative verb, and we use it in the Present Simple tense to talk about <strong>now</strong> situations <em>and</em> about <strong>general</strong> situations. Look at these examples of the verb <em>be</em> in the Present Simple tense - some are <strong>general</strong> and some are <strong>now</strong>:

<p>Main verbs are also called &quot;lexical verbs&quot;.
</p>

<p>Main verbs have meaning on their own (unlike <a href="https://www.englishclub.com/grammar/verbs-classification-helping.htm"><strong>helping verbs</strong></a>). There are thousands of main verbs, and we can classify them in several ways:
</p>

<h2>Transitive and intransitive verbs</h2>

<p>A transitive verb takes a direct object: <em>Somebody killed the President.</em> An intransitive verb does not have a direct object: <em>He died.</em> Many verbs, like <em>speak</em>, can be transitive or intransitive. Look at these examples:
</p>

<p><strong>transitive</strong>:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>I <strong>saw</strong> an elephant.</li>
	<li>We are <strong>watching</strong> TV.</li>
	<li>He <strong>speaks</strong> English.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>intransitive</strong>:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>He has <strong>arrived</strong>.</li>
	<li>John <strong>goes</strong> to school.</li>
	<li>She <strong>speaks</strong> fast.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Linking verbs</h2>

<p>A linking verb does not have much meaning in itself. It &quot;links&quot; the subject to what is said about the subject. Usually, a linking verb shows equality (=) or a change to a different state or place (&rarr;). Linking verbs are always intransitive (but not all intransitive verbs are linking verbs).
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Mary <strong>is</strong> a teacher. (mary = teacher)</li>
	<li>Tara <strong>is</strong> beautiful. (tara = beautiful)</li>
	<li>That <strong>sounds</strong> interesting. (that = interesting)</li>
	<li>The sky <strong>became</strong> dark. (the sky &rarr; dark)</li>
	<li>The bread <strong>has gone</strong> bad. (bread &rarr; bad)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Dynamic and stative verbs</h2>

<p>Some verbs describe action. They are called &quot;dynamic&quot;, and can be used with continuous tenses. Other verbs describe state (non-action, a situation). They are called &quot;stative&quot;, and cannot normally be used with continuous tenses (though some of them can be used with continuous tenses with a change in meaning).
</p>

<p><strong>dynamic verbs</strong> (examples):
</p>

<ul>
	<li>hit, explode, fight, run, go</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>stative verbs</strong> (examples):
</p>

<ul>
	<li>be</li>
	<li>like, love, prefer, wish</li>
	<li>impress, please, surprise</li>
	<li>hear, see, sound</li>
	<li>belong to, consist of, contain, include, need</li>
	<li>appear, resemble, seem</li>
</ul>

<h2>Regular and irregular verbs</h2>

<p>This is more a question of vocabulary than of grammar. The only real difference between regular and irregular verbs is that they have different endings for their past tense and past participle forms. For regular verbs, the past tense ending and past participle ending is always the same: -ed. For irregular verbs, the past tense ending and the past participle ending is variable, so it is necessary to learn them by heart.
</p>

<p><strong>regular verbs:</strong> base, past tense, past participle
</p>

<ul>
	<li>look, looked, looked</li>
	<li>work, worked, worked</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>irregular verbs:</strong> base, past tense, past participle
</p>

<ul>
	<li>buy, bought, bought</li>
	<li>cut, cut, cut</li>
	<li>do, did, done</li>
</ul>
