<p><strong>Climate change may cost India 2.8% of GDP, says World Bank</strong><br />
On 28th June 2018, a World Bank report named &lsquo;South Asia&rsquo;s Hotspots: The Impact of Temperature and Precipitation Changes on Living Standards&rsquo; said that, Climate change might cost India 2.8 % of GDP.
</p>

<p><strong>&lsquo;South Asia&rsquo;s Hotspots: The Impact of Temerature and Precipitation Changes on Living Standards&rsquo;:</strong><br />
<strong>i. </strong>The report also said that, the climate change can depress living standards of around half of India&rsquo;s population by 2050.<br />
<strong>ii. </strong>Average annual temperatures are expected to increase by <strong>1-2 %</strong> over three decades.<br />
<strong>iii. </strong>If no measures are taken, average temperatures in India would increase by <strong>1.5-3 degrees.</strong><br />
<strong>iv. </strong>Even if preventive measures are taken in line with recommendations of Paris climate change agreement of 2015, India&rsquo;s average annual temperatures would increase by <strong>1-2 degrees celsius</strong> by 2050.<br />
<strong>v. </strong>As per the report, nearly half of South Asia&rsquo;s population, including India, lives in the &ldquo;vulnerable areas&rdquo; at present.<br />
<strong>vi. </strong>These regions will be affected by declining living standards that could be attributed to lowering agricultural yields, lower labour productivity or related health impacts.<br />
<strong>vii. </strong>Nearly 600 million people in India currently live in locations that could become moderate or severe hotspots of climate change by 2050 under a business-as-usual scenario.<br />
<strong>viii. </strong>States in central, northern and north-western India are the most vulnerable to changes in average temperature and precipitation.<br />
<strong>ix. </strong>By 2050, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh would be the top two climate hotspot states.<br />
<strong>x. </strong>They would witness a decline of over 9 % in their living standards. They are followed by Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra.<br />
<strong>xi. </strong>7 out of the top 10 most-affected hotspot districts will belong to the Vidarbha region of Maharashtra.<br />
<strong>xii. </strong>These weather changes will lead to lower per capita consumption levels. This would further increase poverty and inequality in South Asia.<br />
<strong>xiii. </strong>To handle negative economic impact in India, the report recommends to improve educational attainment, reducing water stress, and improving job opportunities in non-agricultural sectors.<br />
<strong>xiv. </strong>It also predicts that a 30 % improvement on these measures could reduce the decline in living standards by nearly 1 % from 2.8 % to 1.9 %.<br />
