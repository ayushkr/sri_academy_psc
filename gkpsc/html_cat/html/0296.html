<h1><em>Arrive</em></h1>

<p>We use the verb <em>arrive</em> with <em>at</em> or <em>in</em> to talk about &lsquo;coming to&rsquo;, &lsquo;getting to&rsquo; or &lsquo;reaching&rsquo; a place where a journey ends. If we see the destination as a point, we say <em>arrive at</em>. If we see it as a larger area, we say <em>arrive in</em>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>We <strong>arrived at</strong> the art gallery just as it was closing.</em> (The gallery is seen as a point.)
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Immigrants who <strong>arrived in</strong> the country after 2005 have to take a special language test.</em> (The country is seen as a larger area.)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Warning:
</p>

<p>We don&rsquo;t say <em>arrive to</em> a place:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I always <strong>arrive at</strong> college about half an hour before my classes start.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Not: <s>I always arrive to college</s> &hellip;
</p>
</blockquote>
