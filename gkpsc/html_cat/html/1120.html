<p><strong>Rare double asteroid discovered (Near-Earth asteroid 2017 YE5): NASA</strong><br />
<strong>Near-Earth asteroid 2017 YE5</strong>, an asteroid discovered in 2017, is actually two objects, each around <strong>900 metres</strong> in size and orbiting each other. This has been revealed by new observations made by three of the world&rsquo;s largest radio telescopes.<br />
<strong>Near-Earth asteroid 2017 YE5:</strong><br />
<strong>i. </strong>Near-Earth asteroid 2017 YE5 was discovered with observations provided by the Morocco Oukaimeden Sky Survey in December 2017.<br />
<strong>ii. </strong>Details about the asteroid&rsquo;s physical properties were not known until the end of June 2018.<br />
<strong>iii. </strong>This is the fourth &ldquo;equal mass&rdquo; binary near-Earth asteroid ever detected that consists of two objects nearly identical in size, orbiting each other.<br />
<strong>iv. </strong>The new observations provide the most detailed images ever obtained of this type of binary asteroid.<br />
<strong>v. </strong>21st June 2018, the asteroid 2017 YE5 made its closest approach to Earth for at least the next 170 years. It came within 6 million kilometers of Earth, or around 16 times the distance between Earth and the Moon.<br />
<strong>vi. </strong>On 21st and 22nd June 2018, observations by NASA&rsquo;s Goldstone Solar System Radar (GSSR) in California showed the first signs that 2017 YE5 might be a binary system.<br />
<strong>vii. </strong>The observations showed two distinct lobes. But the asteroid&rsquo;s orientation was such that scientists could not see if the two bodies were separate or joined.<br />
<strong>viii. </strong>Later, the two objects rotated to reveal a gap between them. Scientists at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico along with researchers at the Green Bank Observatory (GBO) in West Virginia confirmed that 2017 YE5 consists of two separated objects.<br />
<strong>ix. </strong>The new observations received between 21st June and 26th June 2018 showed that the two objects revolve around each other once in every <strong>20 to 24 hours</strong>.<br />
<strong>x. </strong>Radar imaging shows that the two objects are larger than their combined optical brightness originally suggested.<br />
<strong>xi. </strong>The two rocks do not reflect as much sunlight as a typical rocky asteroid. 2017 YE5 is said to be <strong>dark like charcoal</strong>.<br />
<strong>xii. </strong>The Goldstone images taken on 21st June 2018 also shows a striking difference in the radar reflectivity of the two objects.<br />
<strong>xiii. </strong>This phenomenon was not seen earlier in over 50 other binary asteroid systems studied by radar since 2000.<br />
<strong>xiii. </strong>The reflectivity differences are also seen in the Arecibo images. This shows that the two objects may have different densities, compositions near their surfaces, or different surface roughness.<br />
<strong>xiv. </strong>Scientists estimate that among near-Earth asteroids larger than 200 metres in size, nearly 15 % are binaries with one larger object and a much smaller satellite. Equal-mass binaries like 2017 YE5 are very rare.<br />
