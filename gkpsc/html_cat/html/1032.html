On June 3, 2018, <strong>Ministry of Environment , Forest and Climate Change</strong> and <strong>The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI)</strong> has inked MOU to set up a <strong>resource efficiency cell.</strong><br />
The initiative taken in the MOU has been launched by Secretary, MoEFCC, Shri CK Mishra and Director General, TERI, Dr Ajay Mathur, at an event at Vigyan Bhawanin Delhi.<br />
<strong>Objective:</strong><br />
To focus on waste management and resource efficiency .<br />
<strong>Salient Features:</strong><br />
<strong>i.</strong> The aim is to promote resource efficiency by enabling coordinated thinking among various ministries.<br />
<strong>ii.</strong> It would focus on system based use of materials, products and processes in India.<br />
<strong>iii.</strong> <strong>European Union</strong> and <strong>MoEFCC</strong> also signed a Joint Declaration of Intent (JDI) to support the  <strong>EU Resource Efficiency Initiative (EU-REI) Project </strong>in India, which would  foster the efficient and sustainable use of natural resources in India.<br />
<strong>iv.</strong> A TERI paper on <strong>Opportunities and Challenges of Plastics Waste Management </strong>has been released that states that annual average per capita consumption of plastic in India is about <strong>11 </strong>kgs, with maximum plastic waste of water and soft drink bottles.<br />
<strong>v.</strong> Seas near Mumbai, Kerala and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands are among the worst polluted in the world. The plastic debris affect at least 267 species worldwide, including 86% of all sea turtle species, 44% of all seabird species, and 43% of all marine mammal species.<br />
<strong>vi</strong>. Effective collection , recycling and use of bio-degradable plastic can reduce emission of Green House Gases (GHG).<br />
<strong>vii.</strong> An industry consortium on <strong>&lsquo;Waste-Proofing the Future&rsquo;</strong> to identify and  sustainably manage waste was launched at the event. The consortium has been launched with <strong>eight</strong> members comprising <strong>Aditya Birla Group, RED FM, KidZania India &ndash; ImagiNation Edutainment India Pvt Ltd, Dalmia (Bharat) Cement Ltd, Uflex Ltd, and DS Group of Companies.</strong><br />
<strong>viii.</strong> To begin with waste collection points will also be set up in schools through KidZania.<br />
<strong>About India&rsquo;s role in waste management :</strong><br />
India generates an estimated <strong>32 million</strong> metric tons of packaging waste each year, of which plastic constitutes 16 per cent. The unorganised collection of waste leads to cherry-picking of wastes, with only 14% of plastic packaging being collected for recycling.<br />
Between 2010 and 2020, India&rsquo;s demand for various materials is estimated to increase from <strong>US $1.4 trillion to US $5 trillion</strong>. Resource efficiency works along the various stages (design, manufacturing, refurbishment, and end-of-life) of product life cycles, including the three &lsquo;<strong>R&rsquo;s &ndash; reduce, reuse,   and recycle.</strong>

On 3rd June 2018, India successfully test-fired <strong>Agni-5</strong>, its indigenously developed nuclear capable long range ballistic missile with strike range of <strong>5,000 km</strong> from Dr Abdul Kalam Island off the <strong>Odisha coast</strong>.<br />
<strong>Agni-5:</strong><br />
<strong>i. </strong>Agni-5 is a surface-to-surface missile. It was launched with the help of a mobile launcher from launch pad-4 of the Integrated Test Range (ITR) at Dr Abdul Kalam Island in the Bay of Bengal.<br />
<strong>ii. </strong>This was the sixth trial of Agni-5. It successfully covered its full distance during the trial.<br />
<strong>iii. </strong>Its flight performance was tracked and monitored by radars, tracking instruments and observation stations throughout the mission.<br />
<strong>iv. </strong>Agni-5 is the most advanced with modern technologies in navigation and guidance, warhead and engine.<br />
<strong>v. </strong>It features very high accuracy <strong>Ring Laser Gyro based Inertial Navigation System (RINS</strong>), and advanced <strong>Micro Navigation System (MINS).</strong><br />
<strong>vi. </strong>It has a high speed on-board computer and fault tolerant software with a robust and reliable bus.<br />
<strong>vii. </strong>Its path is directed by the advanced on-board computer and inertial navigation system.<br />
<strong>viii. </strong>It has 3 stages. It is 17 metres tall and 2 metres wide. It has the capacity to carry a nuclear warhead of 1.5 tonnes.<br />
